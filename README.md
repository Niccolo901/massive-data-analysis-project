This project applies deep learning techniques to classify book genres based on cover images from the Amazon Books dataset. The pipeline includes dataset filtering, asynchronous image downloading, preprocessing, and model training. Two architectures are implemented: a custom CNN for fast experimentation and MobileNetV2 for improved accuracy through transfer learning. All code is written in Python using TensorFlow and executed on Google Colab. Results show that even with limited data, transfer learning provides a notable performance boost. The repository is modular, scalable, and ready for extension to larger or multimodal datasets.
