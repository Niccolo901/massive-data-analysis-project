Crackpots: A Novel,"When we first meet Ruby Reese she’s a spunky kid in a cowgirl hat, tap dancing her way through a slightly off-kilter 1950s childhood. With an insomniac mother and a demolitions-expert father, her entire family is what the residents of her small town would call ""a bunch of crackpots."" Despite the dramas of her upbringing, Ruby matures into a creative, introspective, and wholly beguiling woman. But her adulthood is marked by complex relationships and romantic missteps -- three unsuitable marriages, dramatic crushes, the complicated love between siblings. As Sara Pritchard deftly guides us through Ruby's story, from the present to the past and back again, a portrait of a remarkably resilient woman emerges. Suffused with humor and melancholy, imagination and insight, Crackpots heralds the debut of a skilled and sensitive storyteller.",['Sara Pritchard'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qc4EaxJpFQQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Qc4EaxJpFQQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Crackpots:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperCollins,2003-08-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qc4EaxJpFQQC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0,book_covers/297_Crackpots__A_Novel.jpg,Fiction,0

FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.,"The extraordinary drama of Malta's WWII victory against impossible odds told through the eyes of the people who were there. In March and April 1942, more explosives were dropped on the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta - smaller than the Isle of Wight - than on the whole of Britain during the first year of the Blitz. Malta had become one of the most strategically important places in the world. From there, the Allies could attack Axis supply lines to North Africa; without it, Rommel would be able to march unchecked into Egypt, Suez and the Middle East. For the Allies this would have been catastrophic. As Churchill said, Malta had to be held 'at all costs'. FORTRESS MALTA follows the story through the eyes of those who were there: young men such as twenty-year-old fighter pilot Raoul Daddo-Langlois, anti-aircraft gunner Ken Griffiths, American Art Roscoe and submariner Tubby Crawford - who served on the most successful Allied submarine of the Second World War; cabaret dancer-turned RAF plotter Christina Ratcliffe, and her lover, the brilliant and irrepressible reconnaissance pilot, Adrian Warburton. Their stories and others provide extraordinary first-hand accounts of heroism, resilience, love, and loss, highlighting one of the most remarkable stories of World War II.",['James Holland'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=In85AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=In85AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=FORTRESS+MALTA%3B+AN+ISLAND+UNDER+SIEGE+1940-1943.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Weidenfeld & Nicolson,2013-01-31,http://books.google.com/books?id=In85AgAAQBAJ&dq=FORTRESS+MALTA%3B+AN+ISLAND+UNDER+SIEGE+1940-1943.&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],2.0,book_covers/880_FORTRESS_MALTA__AN_ISLAND_UNDER_SIEGE_1940-1943_.jpg,History,1

Broken Lights and Mended Lives: Theology and Common Life in the Early Church,"A discussion by a broadly respected authority of the complicated relationship between theology and ordinary life in the early church. The first section of the book scrutinizes theology with a view to understanding its bearing upon Christian understandings of life (the theological &“stories&” of Irenaeus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Augustine). The second section examines aspects of ordinary life and explores how Christians related them to religious ideas (the family, hospitality, citizenship, monasticism, and attitudes toward the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West). & This very learned piece of work, which reflects lengthy study of original texts as well as of the current and important secondary literature, is distinctive because it does not conform to the present reigning ideology: The author writes as a convinced Christian thinker. He believes that there is no such thing as a purely detached observer and that the best way of being critical and fair is to make no secret of one&’s presuppositions, but to face them so as to be able to discount them when necessary. This quality makes the work interesting and suggestive. The book is of importance to scholars and theologians and to all concerned with the early church.","['Rowan A.

The Fourth Angel,"From the New York Times–bestselling author of City of Night: a “powerful work that may very well be Rechy’s best” (Kirkus Reviews). Compelling and ferociously relevant, The Fourth Angel is the story of four teenagers playing deadly games with drugs, sex, and one another. Behind a facade of tough cynicism, on a raging search for kicks, they explore the hot, dusty city, bent on trouble. There are three “angels”—Shell, Cob, and Manny—and their recruit Jerry, who becomes the fourth. Hovering in that uncertain limbo between childhood and adulthood, the four angels maintain a precarious balance among themselves and with the outside world. Each one is today’s street kid: still tinged with innocence and capable of beauty, but at the same time, full of rage and violence, attempting to conceal an ugly past. Praise for John Rechy “Rechy shows great comic and tragic talent. He is truly a gifted novelist.” —Christopher Isherwood, author and playwright “His tone rings absolutely true, is absolutely his own, and he has the kind of discipline which allows him a rare and beautiful recklessness. He tells the truth, and tells it with such passion that we are forced to share in the life he conveys. This is a most humbling and liberating achievement.” —James Baldwin, novelist, playwright, and activist “Fresh, beautiful, totally courageous and totally cool, passionate . . . His uncompromising honesty as a gay writer has provoked as much fear as admiration . . . John Rechy doesn’t fit into categories. He transcends them. His individual vision is unique, perfect, loving and strong.” —Carolyn See, author of Dreaming: Hard Luck and Good Times in America",['Peter G.

Following his dismissal from the Royal Navy (a false accusation), he has earned reinstatement through his daring exploits as a privateer, brilliantly chronicled in The Letter of Marque. Now he is to shepherd Stephen Maturin—his friend, ship's surgeon, and sometimes intelligence agent—on a diplomatic mission to prevent links between Bonaparte and the Malay princes which would put English merchant shipping at risk. The journey of the Diane encompasses a great and satisfying diversity of adventures. Maturin climbs the Thousand Steps of the sacred crater of the orangutans; a killer typhoon catches Aubrey and his crew trying to work the Diane off a reef; and in the barbaric court of Pulo Prabang a classic duel of intelligence agents unfolds: the French envoys, well entrenched in the Sultan's good graces, against the savage cunning of Stephen Maturin.","[""Patrick O'Brian""]",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vrMJFxQaNxYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=vrMJFxQaNxYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Thirteen-Gun+Salute:+Aubrey/Maturin+Series,+Book+13&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",W.

An Exposition of the Sermon on the Mount:,"""And seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain, and when He was set, His disciples came unto Him; and He opened His mouth, and taught them"" (5:1, 2). Yet brief as these verses be, there are several things in them which call for careful consideration. First, we must notice the place from which this Sermon was preached. ""As in other things, so in this, our Lord Jesus was but ill-accommodated: He had no convenient place to preach in, any more than to lay His head on. While the scribes and Pharisees had Moses' chair to sit in, with all possible ease, honour, and state, and there corrupted the Law; our Lord Jesus, the great Teacher of truth, is driven out to the desert, and finds no better place than a 'mountain' can afford.",['Arthur W.

Animal Underworld: Inside America's Black Market for Rare and Exotic Species,"A vast and previously undisclosed underground economy exists in the United States. The products bought and sold: animals. In Animal Underworld, veteran investigative journalist Alan Green exposes the sleazy, sometimes illegal web of those who trade in rare and exotic creatures. Green and The Center for Public Integrity reveal which American zoos and amusement parks dump their ""surplus"" animals on the middlemen adept at secretly redirecting them into the private pet trade. We're taken to exotic-animal auctions, where the anonymous high bidders are often notorious dealers, hunting-ranch proprietors, and profit-minded charlatans masquerading as conservationists.

Down Range: Navy SEALs in the War on Terrorism,"In America’s battle against global terrorism, the goal of the Navy SEALs is to be the best guns in the fight—stealthy, effective, professional, and lethal. Here for the first time is a SEAL insider’s battle history of these Special Operations warriors in the war on terrorism. “Down range” is what SEALs in Afghanistan and Iraq call their area of operations. In this new mode of warfare, “down range” can refer to anything from tracking roving bands of al-Qaeda on a remote mountain trail in Afghanistan to taking down an armed compound in Tikrit and rousting holdouts from Saddam Hussein’s regime. It could mean interdicting insurgents smuggling car-bomb explosives over the Iraqi-Syrian border or silently boarding a freighter on the high seas at night to enforce an embargo. In other words, “down range” could be anywhere, anytime, under any conditions. In Down Range, author Dick Couch, himself a former Navy SEAL and CIA case officer, uses his unprecedented access to bring the reader firsthand accounts from the warriors in combat during key missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Couch creates a pulse-pounding, detailed narrative of the definitive engagements of this war, while painting an unusually intimate portrait of these warriors in the field. The performance of the SEALs in difficult, changing environments—in the heat of the Afghan desert, in the snow-packed Hindu Kush, on the high seas, and in the urban chaos of Baghdad—has been nothing short of extraordinary. The SEALs, coordinating with other American forces, the CIA, and foreign special operations units like the Polish GROM, have once more shown their genius for improvisation and capacity for courageous action in leading the fight against this new and vicious enemy. The first battle history of its kind, Down Range is a riveting close-up of some of America’s finest warriors in action against a deadly foe.",['Dick Couch'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eqYNOg-HWR0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eqYNOg-HWR0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Down+Range:+Navy+SEALs+in+the+War+on+Terrorism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown,2005-07-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eqYNOg-HWR0C&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0,book_covers/945_Down_Range__Navy_SEALs_in_the_War_on_Terrorism.jpg,History,1
"War Machines: Transforming Technologies in the U.S. Military, 1920-1940 (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","The American military establishment is intimately tied to its technology, although the nature of those ties has varied enormously from service to service. The air force evokes images of pilots operating hightech weapons systems, striking precisely from out of the blue to lay waste to enemy installations. The fundamental icon for the Marine Corps is a wave of riflemen hitting the beaches from rugged landing craft and slogging their way ashore under enemy fire. How did these very different relationships with technology develop? During the interwar years, from 1920 to 1940, leaders from the Army Air Corps and the Marine Corps recreated their agencies based on visions of new military technologies. In War Machines, Timothy Moy examines these recreations and explores how factors such as bureaucratic pressure, institutional culture, and America's technological enthusiasm shaped these leaders' choices. The very existence of the Army Air Corps was based on a new technology, the airplane. As the Air Corps was forced to compete for money and other resources during the years after World War I, Air Corps leaders carved out a military niche based on hightech precision bombing. The Marine Corps focused on amphibious, firstwave assault using sturdy, graceless, and easytoproduce landing craft. Moy's astute analysis makes it clear that studying the processes that shaped the Army Air Corps and Marine Corps is fundamental to our understanding of technology and the military at the beginning of the twentyfirst century.",['Timothy Moy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_iSpCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=_iSpCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=War+Machines:+Transforming+Technologies+in+the+U.S.+Military,+1920-1940+(Williams-Ford+Texas+A&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Texas A&M University Press,2016-03-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_iSpCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/680_War_Machines__Transforming_Technologies_in_the_U_S__Military__1920-1940__Williams-Ford_Texas_A_M__University_Military_History_Series_.jpg,History,1
"German Women for Empire, 1884 1945 (Politics, History, and Culture)","When Germany annexed colonies in Africa and the Pacific beginning in the 1880s, many German women were enthusiastic. At the same time, however, they found themselves excluded from what they saw as a great nationalistic endeavor. In German Women for Empire, 1884–1945 Lora Wildenthal untangles the varied strands of racism, feminism, and nationalism that thread through German women’s efforts to participate in this episode of overseas colonization. In confrontation and sometimes cooperation with men over their place in the colonial project, German women launched nationalist and colonialist campaigns for increased settlement and new state policies. Wildenthal analyzes recently accessible Colonial Office archives as well as mission society records, periodicals, women’s memoirs, and fiction to show how these women created niches for themselves in the colonies. They emphasized their unique importance for white racial “purity” and the inculcation of German culture in the family. While pressing for career opportunities for themselves, these women also campaigned against interracial marriage and circulated an image of African and Pacific women as sexually promiscuous and inferior. As Wildenthal discusses, the German colonial imaginary persisted even after the German colonial empire was no longer a reality. The women’s colonial movement continued into the Nazi era, combining with other movements to help turn the racialist thought of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries into the hierarchical evaluation of German citizens as well as colonial subjects. Students and scholars of women’s history, modern German history, colonial politics and culture, postcolonial theory, race/ethnicity, and gender will welcome this groundbreaking study.",['Lora Wildenthal'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WK7wTLVneYsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=WK7wTLVneYsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=German+Women+for+Empire,+1884+1945+(Politics,+History,+and+Culture)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Duke University Press,2001-11-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WK7wTLVneYsC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/769_German_Women_for_Empire__1884_1945__Politics__History__and_Culture_.jpg,History,1

The Origins of the Urban Crisis,"The reasons behind Detroit’s persistent racialized poverty after World War II Once America's ""arsenal of democracy,"" Detroit is now the symbol of the American urban crisis. In this reappraisal of America’s racial and economic inequalities, Thomas Sugrue asks why Detroit and other industrial cities have become the sites of persistent racialized poverty. He challenges the conventional wisdom that urban decline is the product of the social programs and racial fissures of the 1960s. Weaving together the history of workplaces, unions, civil rights groups, political organizations, and real estate agencies, Sugrue finds the roots of today’s urban poverty in a hidden history of racial violence, discrimination, and deindustrialization that reshaped the American urban landscape after World War II. This Princeton Classics edition includes a new preface by Sugrue, discussing the lasting impact of the postwar transformation on urban America and the chronic issues leading to Detroit’s bankruptcy.",['Thomas J.

"The analects of Confucius,","This carefully crafted ebook: “Classic The Analects (The Revised James Legge Translation)” is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. This book is the revised James Legge translation which has been extensively reworked and restored compared to the freely available Legge translations. The Analects, also known as the Analects of Confucius, is the collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been written by Confucius' followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC–221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the Analects was considered merely a ""commentary"" on the Five Classics, but the status of the Analects grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. During the late Song dynasty (960-1279) the importance of the Analects as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the ""Four Books"". The Analects has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. Confucius (551–479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history.",['Confucius'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+analects+of+Confucius,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",e-artnow,2013-09-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/652_The_analects_of_Confucius_.jpg,Religion,2
"Monks, Rulers, and Literati: The Political Ascendancy of Chan Buddhism","The Chan (Zen in Japanese) school began when, in seventh-century China, a small religious community gathered around a Buddhist monk named Hongren. Over the centuries, Chan Buddhism grew from an obscure movement to an officially recognized and eventually dominant form of Buddhism in China and throughout East Asia. It has reached international popularity, its teachings disseminated across cultures far and wide. In Monks, Rulers, and Literati, Albert Welter presents, for the first time in a comprehensive fashion in a Western work, the story of the rise of Chan, a story which has been obscured by myths about Zen. Zen apologists in the twentieth century, Welter argues, sold the world on the story of Zen as a transcendental spiritualism untainted by political and institutional involvements. In fact, Welter shows that the opposite is true: relationships between Chan monks and political rulers were crucial to Chan's success. The book concentrates on an important but neglected period of Chan history, the 10th and 11th centuries, when monks and rulers created the so-called Chan ""golden age"" and the classic principles of Chan identity. Placing Chan's ascendancy into historical context, Welter analyzes the social and political factors that facilitated Chan's success as a movement. He then examines how this success was represented in the Chan narrative and the aims of those who shaped it. Monks, Rulers, and Literati recovers a critical period of Zen's past, deepening our understanding of how the movement came to flourish. Welter's groundbreaking work is not only the most comprehensive history of the dominant strand of East Asian Buddhism, but also an important corrective to many of the stereotypes about Zen.",['Asian Religions University of Winnipeg Albert Welter Professor'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0D0IUv8NeWMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=0D0IUv8NeWMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Monks,+Rulers,+and+Literati:+The+Political+Ascendancy+of+Chan+Buddhism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","Oxford University Press, USA",2006-01-11,"http://books.google.com/books?id=0D0IUv8NeWMC&dq=Monks,+Rulers,+and+Literati:+The+Political+Ascendancy+of+Chan+Buddhism&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Religion'],,book_covers/352_Monks__Rulers__and_Literati__The_Political_Ascendancy_of_Chan_Buddhism.jpg,Religion,2

But there is an out-of-tune piano in the small apartment, and in unlocking the secrets of its keys, as if by magic, Claude discovers himself. He is a musical prodigy. Body & Soul is the story of a young man whose life is transformed by a gift. The gift is not without price—the work is relentless, the teachers exacting—but the reward is a journey that takes him to the drawing rooms of the rich and powerful, private schools, a gilt-edged marriage, and Carnegie Hall. Claude moves through this life as if he were playing a difficult composition, swept up in its drama and tension, surprised by its grace notes. Music, here, becomes a character in its own right, equaled in strength only by the music of Frank Conroy’s own unmistakable and true voice. Bristling with character and invention, Body & Soul is Dickensian in its range and richness. This is a novel with all the emotional appeal and moral gravity of a classic bildungsroman, but with a tone as contemporary as a jazz riff—an unforgettable achievement by one of the great writers of our time.",['Frank Conroy'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4U1i2M1GT-sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4U1i2M1GT-sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Body+and+Soul&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HMH,1993-09-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4U1i2M1GT-sC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/144_Body_and_Soul.jpg,Fiction,0

Elect in the Son,"""Through the years, I have read carefully every serious work on the question of election...I found no work that addressed itself to the question in this thorough, objective, competent manner or afforded such satisfactory, obviously Biblical constructions.... I have every confidence that time will prove this to be the definitive work on the difficult question of election.""--from the Introduction by Dr. William W. Adams of the Southern Baptist Theological SeminaryIn this comprehensive treatment of all pertinent Scripture passages dealing with election, Dr. Shank demonstrates that Calvin's doctrine of the unconditional election and the reprobation of particular people is without foundation in the Scriptures. He challenges the use of certain ""proof passages"" and shows that their application in this manner requires circumventing some of the most explicitly categorical affirmations of Scripture.Dr. Shank demonstrates that the election of grace does not rule out the salvation of any man, that God truly wills all men to be saved.

The Reckoning,"From the patristic age until the Gregorian calendar reform of 1582, computus -- the science of time reckoning and art of calendar construction -- was a matter of intense concern. Bede's The Reckoning of Time (De temporum ratione) was the first comprehensive treatise on this subject and the model and reference for all subsequent teaching discussion and criticism of the Christian calendar. It is a systematic exposition of the Julian solar calendar and the Paschal table of Dionysius Exiguus, with their related formulae for calculating dates. But it is more than a technical handbook. Bede sets calendar lore within a broad scientific framework and a coherent Christian concept of time, and incorporates themes as diverse as the theory of tides and the doctrine of the millennium. This translation of the full text of The Reckoning of Time includes an extensive historical introduction and a chapter-by-chapter commentary. It will interest historians of medieval science, theology, and education, Bede scholars and Anglo-Saxonists, liturgists, and Church historians. It will also serve as an accessible introduction to computus itself. Generations of medieval computists nourished their expertise in Bede's orderly presentation; modern scholars in quest of safe passage through this complex terrain can hope for no better guide.","['Beda (Venerabilis.)', 'Beda Venerabilis (helgon.)', 'el Venerable Beda (Santo)', 'Bede Venerabilis Staff', 'Bede, the Venerable, Saint, 673-735']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yFsw-Vaup6sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=yFsw-Vaup6sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Reckoning&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Liverpool University Press,1999-01-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=yFsw-Vaup6sC&dq=The+Reckoning&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/873_The_Reckoning.jpg,History,1

Florida's Indians from Ancient Times to the Present,"""Assembles a variety of hard-to-find articles on two important Florida sites. [Milanich's introduction] provides an updated interpretation of the sites and a context for the classic articles.""--Elizabeth D. Benchley, University of West Florida Two of the most famous archaeological monuments in the southeastern United States--excavated first a century ago--are in Florida. Both Crystal River (near the Gulf Coast in Citrus County) and Mount Royal (on the St. Johns River just north of Lake George) help shape our appreciation of precolumbian Native American cultures. This volume, written by some of the most notable American archaeologists, presents for the first time the most extensive literature on fieldwork at the sites, including descriptions of the extraordinary artifacts from each. In a well-referenced introduction, Jerald Milanich places both monuments in context and addresses the persistent controversies and uncertainties that surround them, answering questions such as when Mount Royal's large mound was constructed, why an array of copper artifacts was found there, and whether evidence supports the contention that Crystal River was a solar observatory with direct ties to the Maya.

The Four Gospels: An Introduction,"The Fourth Gospel has played an important role in the course of Christian theology and remains one of the most cherished writings of the New Testament.

Rembrandt's Jews,"There is a popular and romantic myth about Rembrandt and the Jewish people. One of history's greatest artists, we are often told, had a special affinity for Judaism. With so many of Rembrandt's works devoted to stories of the Hebrew Bible, and with his apparent penchant for Jewish themes and the sympathetic portrayal of Jewish faces, it is no wonder that the myth has endured for centuries. Rembrandt's Jews puts this myth to the test as it examines both the legend and the reality of Rembrandt's relationship to Jews and Judaism. In his elegantly written and engrossing tour of Jewish Amsterdam—which begins in 1653 as workers are repairing Rembrandt's Portuguese-Jewish neighbor's house and completely disrupting the artist's life and livelihood—Steven Nadler tells us the stories of the artist's portraits of Jewish sitters, of his mundane and often contentious dealings with his neighbors in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam, and of the tolerant setting that city provided for Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews fleeing persecution in other parts of Europe. As Nadler shows, Rembrandt was only one of a number of prominent seventeenth-century Dutch painters and draftsmen who found inspiration in Jewish subjects. Looking at other artists, such as the landscape painter Jacob van Ruisdael and Emmanuel de Witte, a celebrated painter of architectural interiors, Nadler is able to build a deep and complex account of the remarkable relationship between Dutch and Jewish cultures in the period, evidenced in the dispassionate, even ordinary ways in which Jews and their religion are represented—far from the demonization and grotesque caricatures, the iconography of the outsider, so often found in depictions of Jews during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Through his close look at paintings, etchings, and drawings; in his discussion of intellectual and social life during the Dutch Golden Age; and even through his own travels in pursuit of his subject, Nadler takes the reader through Jewish Amsterdam then and now—a trip that, under ever-threatening Dutch skies, is full of colorful and eccentric personalities, fiery debates, and magnificent art.",['Steven Nadler'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3sWuCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3sWuCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rembrandt%27s+Jews&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Chicago Press,2015-08-04,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3sWuCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/969_Rembrandt_s_Jews.jpg,History,1
"Life of the Mind, The: A Christian Perspective (RenewedMinds)","What purpose do purely intellectual pursuits have in the lives of Christians? Why should Christians study subjects that have little bearing on their future careers and ministry? In a style reminiscent of the work of Arthur Holmes and Harry Blamires, veteran professor of philosophy Clifford Williams addresses these issues and more in this succinct and accessible examination of the life of the mind. Christians cultivating the life of the mind actively pursue situations and discussions that require experimentation, reflection, and perseverance. They are interested in the acquisition of knowledge that is both unrelated and directly related to their faith. Williams answers common Christian objections to such activities, describes the virtues of the person who engages in the life of the mind, and asserts that the life of the mind is justifiably a Christian calling. The Life of the Mind is directed toward college students contemplating the importance of college and intellectual activity in general, but it will be enjoyed by all committed to developing a Christian mind.",['Clifford Williams'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lJrbHaaQR5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=lJrbHaaQR5EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Life+of+the+Mind,+The:+A+Christian+Perspective+(RenewedMinds)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Baker Academic,2002-03-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lJrbHaaQR5EC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/663_Life_of_the_Mind__The__A_Christian_Perspective__RenewedMinds_.jpg,Religion,2

Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter,"In Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea, his fourth volume to explore “the hinges of history,” Thomas Cahill escorts the reader on another entertaining—and historically unassailable—journey through the landmarks of art and bloodshed that defined Greek culture nearly three millennia ago. In the city-states of Athens and Sparta and throughout the Greek islands, honors could be won in making love and war, and lives were rife with contradictions. By developing the alphabet, the Greeks empowered the reader, demystified experience, and opened the way for civil discussion and experimentation—yet they kept slaves. The glorious verses of the Iliad recount a conflict in which rage and outrage spur men to action and suggest that their “bellicose society of gleaming metals and rattling weapons” is not so very distant from more recent campaigns of “shock and awe.” And, centuries before Zorba, Greece was a land where music, dance, and freely flowing wine were essential to the high life. Granting equal time to the sacred and the profane, Cahill rivets our attention to the legacies of an ancient and enduring worldview.

Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ,"Who is Jesus Christ? You've never met him in person, and you don't know anyone who has. But there is a way to know who he is. How? Jesus Christ-the divine Person revealed in the Bible-has a unique excellence and a spiritual beauty that speaks directly to our souls and says, ""Yes, this is truth."" It's like seeing the sun and knowing that it is light, or tasting honey and knowing that it is sweet. The depth and complexity of Jesus shatter our simple mental frameworks. He baffled proud scribes with his wisdom but was understood and loved by children. He calmed a raging storm with a word but would not get himself down from the cross. Look at the Jesus of the Bible. Keep your eyes open, and fill them with the portrait of Jesus in God's Word. Jesus said, ""If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.""

One August day: A novel,"In less than six hours in August 1942, nearly 1,000 British, Canadian and American commandos died in the French port of Dieppe in an operation that for decades seemed to have no real purpose.

Historian David O’Keefe uses hitherto classified intelligence archives to prove that this catastrophic and apparently futile raid was in fact a mission, set up by Ian Fleming of British Naval Intelligence as part of a ‘pinch’ policy designed to capture material relating to the four-rotor Enigma Machine that would permit codebreakers like Alan Turing at Bletchley Park to turn the tide of the Second World War. ‘A fast-paced and convincing book ... that clears up decades of misinformation about the ignoble raid’ Toronto Star",['David O’Keefe'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NsLvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NsLvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=One+August+day:+A+novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Icon Books,2020-11-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NsLvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/800_One_August_day__A_novel.jpg,History,1

Using an extraordinary array of more than one hundred original documents, he crafts a compelling and comprehensive account of this celebrated year-long protest of racial segregation. Daybreak of Freedom reverberates with the voices of those closest to the bus boycott, ranging from King and his inner circle, to Jo Ann Robinson and other women leaders who started the protest, to the maids, cooks, and other 'foot soldiers' who carried out the struggle.

Erebus,"Driven by a passion for travel and history and a love of ships and the sea, former Monty Python stalwart and beloved television globe-trotter Michael Palin explores the world of HMS Erebus, last seen on an ill-fated voyage to chart the Northwest Passage. Michael Palin brings the fascinating story of the Erebus and its occupants to life, from its construction as a bomb vessel in 1826 through the flagship years of James Clark Ross’s Antarctic expedition and finally to Sir John Franklin’s quest for the holy grail of navigation—a route through the Northwest Passage, where the ship disappeared into the depths of the sea for more than 150 years. It was rediscovered under the arctic waters in 2014. Palin travels across the world—from Tasmania to the Falkland Islands and the Canadian Arctic—to offer a firsthand account of the terrain and conditions that would have confronted the Erebus and her doomed final crew. Delving into the research, he describes the intertwined careers of the two men who shared the ship’s journeys: Ross, the organizational genius who mapped much of the Antarctic coastline and oversaw some of the earliest scientific experiments to be conducted there; and Franklin, who, at the age of sixty and after a checkered career, commanded the ship on its last disastrous venture.

God Hidden and Revealed: The interpretation of Luther's deus absconditus and its significance for religious thought,"Excerpt from God Hidden and Revealed: The Interpretation of Luther's Deus Absconditus and Its Significance for Religious Thought In a conversation with William Adams Brown shortly before his death, he said to me: ""We have lost the first person of the trinity in contemporary Protestantism and only the second person is left."" This statement was surprising, since it came from the lips of one of the leading representatives of the theological school which was largely responsible for the situation he described. The fact to which he pointed was the loss of a feeling for the divine majesty, for the infinite and terrifying character of God's mystery, for the divine holiness which transcends everything intellectual and moral. The problem of the hidden God is the focus around which the divinity of the divine has been rediscover in our time. This makes Professor Dillenberger's book extremely important. By showing the diverse ways in which modern theologians understood and used Luther's notion of the hidden God, this book discloses the struggle for a new understanding and the two main ways in which the concept is conceived. Sometimes God is understood as hidden behind his revelation in Christ, as abysmal, ineffable, as the ""naked God"" before whom no man can stand. Included is the God of the mystery of predestination and of the eternal destiny of man. There is, however, another understanding of the hiddenness of God. The paradox of the cross and the working of God according to the law of contrast, make him hidden and leave him open only for faith. Power in weakness, glory in suffering, life in death show how hidden he is. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Spirituality in Social Work: New Directions,"As Spirituality in Social Work: New Directions shows you, there has been an increase of interest among social workers concerning spiritual matters. In response to this collective interest, Edward Canda and several other members of the Society for Spirituality and Social Work have compiled a thorough and timely compendium of social work research, theory, and practice. Their book will guide you in your efforts to meet the needs of your families and clients while still remaining educated and respectful of the many religous and nonreligious views different people have. In Spirituality in Social Work, you'll get an update on the current state of spirituality, social work scholarship, and education. From there, you'll move on to current appraisals of the many specialized ways social work educators are teaching spirituality in MSW programs, and you'll ultimately come full circle to a fuller understanding of the many ways social work and spirituality complement and inform each other in the classroom as well as in the field of practice. Most importantly, you'll get specific guidance on these topics: how to enhance the intuition of social workers when to apply the Transegoic model to a dying adolescent where to engage in conceptions of spirituality in social work literature what Taoist insights can do to enhance social work practice how social work can prosper in future efforts to link spirituality and social work In many ways, Spirituality in Social Work is a spiritual awakening in its own right--for social workers, for individuals, and for communities at large. The demand for social work practitioners, educators, and community officials to be cross-trained in spirituality and social work is on the rise. So, if you're struggling to find new ways to deal with the ever-increasing and ever-diversifying demand for spiritual training in your particular social work setting, pick up this insightful edition and find new hope and direction in the many different ways that social work and spirituality can work together for you.",['Edward R Canda'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E0EJiivmxCIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=E0EJiivmxCIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Spirituality+in+Social+Work:+New+Directions&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2012-11-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E0EJiivmxCIC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/358_Spirituality_in_Social_Work__New_Directions.jpg,Religion,2
Fathers & Sons,"When in 1705 Kornell Csillag's grandfather returns destitute to his native Hungary from exile, he happens across a gold fob-watch gleaming in the mud. The shipwrecked fortunes of the Csillag family suddenly take a new and marvelous turn. The golden watch brings an unexpected gift to the future generations of firstborn sons: clairvoyance. Passed down from father to son, this gift offers the ability to look into the future or back into history–for some it is considered a blessing, for others a curse. No matter the outcome, each generation records its astonishing, vivid, and revelatory visions into a battered journal that becomes known as The Book of Fathers. For three hundred years the Csillag family line meanders unbroken across Hungary's rivers and vineyards, through a land overrun by wolves and bandits, scarred by plague and massacre, and brutalized by despots. Impetuous, tenderhearted, and shrewd, the Csillags give birth to scholars and gamblers, artists and entrepreneurs. Led astray by unruly passions, they marry frigid French noblewomen and thieving alehouse whores. They change their name and their religion, and change them back. They wander from home but always return, and through it all The Book of Fathers bears witness to holocaust and wedding feast alike.",['Miklos Vamos'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=375vDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=375vDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Fathers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,"Other Press, LLC",2009-10-13,http://books.google.com/books?id=375vDwAAQBAJ&dq=Fathers&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],4.0,book_covers/58_Fathers___Sons.jpg,Fiction,0

Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out,"Ibn Warraq is a courageous writer on Islam and a passionate defender of reason who continues to struggle on behalf of reason with a culture that seems to be at odds with reason. In this respect, his work, as in the preparation of this edited volume, is an indispensable tool for Muslims themselves so they can wage their struggle for enlightenment and reform of their faith tradition.- Middle East Quarterly...probably the first book of its kind-a compendium of testimonies from former Muslims about the reasons for their estrangement from the Islamic faith itself.-New York Review of BooksIn the West abandoning one's religion (apostasy) can be a difficult, emotional decision, which sometimes has social repercussions. However, in culturally diverse societies where there is a mixture of ethnic groups and various philosophies of life, most people look upon such shifts in intellectual allegiance as a matter of personal choice and individual right. By contrast, in Islam apostasy is still viewed as an almost unthinkable act, and in orthodox circles it is considered a crime punishable by death. Renowned scholar of Islamic Studies Bernard Lewis described the seriousness of leaving the Islamic faith in the following dire terms: Apostasy was a crime as well as a sin, and the apostate was damned both in this world and the next. His crime was treason ù desertion and betrayal of the community to which he belonged, and to which he owed loyalty; his life and property were forfeit. He was a dead limb to be excised.Defying the death penalty applicable to all apostates in Islam, the ex-Muslims who are here represented feel it is their duty to speak up against their former faith, to tell the truth about the fastest growing religion in the world. These former Muslims, from all parts of the Islamic world, recount how they slowly came to realize that the religion into which they were born was in many respects unbelievable and sometimes even dangerous.These memoirs of personal journeys to enlightenment and intellectual freedom make for moving reading and are a courageous signal to other ex-Muslims to come out of the closet.Ibn Warraq is the highly acclaimed author of Why I Am Not a Muslim and Defending the West. He is also the editor of The Origins of the Koran, What the Koran Really Says, Leaving Islam, The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, and Which Koran'.",['Ibn Warraq'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9q0y21B9BoUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9q0y21B9BoUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Leaving+Islam:+Apostates+Speak+Out&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Prometheus Books,2003,http://books.google.com/books?id=9q0y21B9BoUC&dq=Leaving+Islam:+Apostates+Speak+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],4.0,book_covers/463_Leaving_Islam__Apostates_Speak_Out.jpg,Religion,2

"The Writings of Henry David Thoreau Journal Edited by Bradford Torrey VI December 1, 1853-August 30, 1854 (Thoreau's Writings, 10)","L’œuvre et la pensée de H.D.Thoreau semblent devoir éternellement se résumer à ses deux textes les plus célèbres, Walden ou la vie dans les bois et La Désobéissance civile, occultant un parcours riche et complexe. Au risque d’écorner l’image d’Epinal que s’en est fait la postérité, cette biographie française du grand écrivain de la Nature se propose de révéler les aspects les moins connus de sa vie et de sa réflexion qui, loin d’en souffrir, s’en trouveront au contraire rehaussées de cet éclairage nouveau. Pur produit de son époque, Thoreau fut un esprit libre, mais en bon transcendantal qui se respecte, il se faisait avant tout le chantre d’une liberté individuelle..., ce qui ne l’empêcha pas de s’engager activement dans la lutte contre l’esclavage. Il ne fut pas non plus cet ermite vivant dans sa cabane au milieu des bois, mais un homme qui entretint sa vie durant une relation panthéiste avec la Nature fortement nourrie de son admiration pour la culture amérindienne. Auteur d’un immense journal de 8000 pages qui reste à découvrir en France et qui constitue sans doute l’une des œuvres maîtresses de la littérature américaine, ami de Ralph Waldo Emerson, le théoricien du Transcendantalisme, de Nathaniel Hawthorne ou de Walt Whitman, nourri de littérature classique et de philosophie orientale, éternel célibataire et solitaire, mais aux amitiés masculines et féminines innombrables, brillant conférencier, arpenteur inlassable des environs de son village natal, Thoreau concentre en lui cette indépendance intemporelle et cet appel du Wild qui constituent l’âme de la nation américaine.",['Thierry Gillyboeuf'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tYuPBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=tYuPBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=The+Writings+of+Henry+David+Thoreau+Journal+Edited+by+Bradford+Torrey+VI+December+1,+1853-August+30,+1854+(Thoreau%27s+Writings,+10)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Fayard,2012-10-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tYuPBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/131_The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau_Journal_Edited_by_Bradford_Torrey_VI_December_1__1853-August_30__1854__Thoreau_s_Writings__10_.jpg,Fiction,0
1-2 Corinthians (New Cambridge Bible Commentary),"Despite his special pastoral relationship with the church in Corinth, Paul confronted numerous local and cultural problems needing to be addressed.

Winner's Circle,"Book 17 of the nationally bestselling Joanne Kilbourn series is classic Gail Bowen: masterfully compelling storytelling that combines a modern, urban family with a gripping, satisfying mystery. As Joanne Kilbourn-Shreve, her husband, Zack, and their soon-to-be seventeen-year-old daughter, Taylor, rush through the rain from their cottage to their car, the Thanksgiving weekend they just spent at the lake with Zack's law partners is already slipping away, burnished into memory as pleasantly as the hundreds of other weekends the Falconer-Shreve families have shared at Lawyers' Bay. Thoughts of the weekend past will now focus on the future and be prefaced by the words ""next time."" Within weeks, a triple homicide will rip apart the lives of those related to the lawyers who, at the end of their first year in law school, only half-jokingly styled themselves ""The Winners' Circle."" Dazed by grief, Joanne will seek answers to an impossible question: ""Why did they die?"" The facts behind the suicide of Christopher Altieri, known by his law partners as ""the conscience of The Winners' Circle,"" appear to provide insights, but for Joanne those insights raise new, unsettling questions.

In the Absence of Men: A Novel,"'An astonishing love story, beautifully told' Time Out 'I am sixteen. I am as old as the century' It is 1916. Vincent is sixteen, on the brink of manhood. Vincent is aristocratic and privileged, frequenting the salons of Paris while France is at war and the city almost deserted of men. In that brutal summer, Vincent's beauty and precocity captivate two men: Marcel, thirty years his senior, a writer and celebrated socialite; and Arthur, the twenty-one year old son of one of the servants, who is now a soldier at the front. As both relationships develop Vincent intuitively tries to keep his passions separate, but over the weeks of indolent Parisian summer and far-off war, confidences are made, absences endured, secrets revealed. All of these men will suffer, and Vincent will lose the last vestiges of his childhood innocence.

Laughing Whitefish,"Laughing Whitefish is an engrossing trail drama of ethnic hostility and the legal defense of Indian treaties. Young Lawyer William (Willy) Poe puts out a shingle in Marquette, Michigan, in 1873, hoping to meet a woman who will take him seriously. His first client, the alluring Charlotte Kawbawgam, known as Laughing Whitefish, offers an enticing challenge—a compelling case of injustice at the hands of powerful mining interests. Years earlier, Charlotte's father led the Jackson Mining Company to a lucrative iron ore strike, and he was then granted a small share in the mine, which the new owners refuse to honor. Willy is now Charlotte's sole recourse for justice. Laughing Whitefish is a gripping account of barriers between Indian people and their legal rights. These poignant conflicts are delicately wrought by the pre-eminent master of the trial thriller, the best-selling author of Anatomy of a Murder. This new edition includes a foreword by Matthew L.M. Fletcher, Director of the Indigenous Law and Policy Center at Michigan State University, that contextualizes the novel and actual decisions of the Michigan Supreme Court ruling in favor of Charlotte.",['Robert Traver'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m95VlbDL4iUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=m95VlbDL4iUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Laughing+Whitefish&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,MSU Press,2012-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m95VlbDL4iUC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0,book_covers/118_Laughing_Whitefish.jpg,Fiction,0

Knot Again!,"Sometimes fireman Lucas Strong feels like he can only find any peace and quiet at the local laundromat, where every day is rinse and repeat -- until a fateful run-in with his high school crush. Hoping to attract more customers to his family's knitting shop, Lucas Strong participated in an FDNY charity calendar and accidentally became a local celebrity. The only place he can find solace is Scrubs--a 24/7 laundromat where he can disappear for a couple of hours. But Lucas's soapy sanctuary is shaken by an inquisitive little girl with a late-night interest in knitting, whose mother is his old school crush. Sydney Harris knows that Harlem is like any other small town, and everyone is probably whispering about how she left such a good man--and a good life--behind to wash and fold laundry by the pound. If only they knew the truth. But Sydney will always put her daughter's happiness first, even if that means moving back to Harlem and facing her past. What Sydney never expected was to see Lucas again. A long-forgotten attraction kicks into high gear as Lucas and Sydney start to spend time together at the laundromat, and they must decide if this is true love or just an infatuation, thin and fragile as a soap bubble.",['Kwana Jackson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hn93EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=hn93EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=Knot+Again!&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2022,http://books.google.com/books?id=hn93EAAAQBAJ&dq=Knot+Again!&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/128_Knot_Again_.jpg,Fiction,0

Orlando and Orange County (Images of America (Arcadia Publishing)),"Orlando amounted to little more than scattered log cabins in the pine forest when Orange County established it as the county seat in 1857. One of the earliest buildings was a log hotel, indicating Orlando's future as a tourist destination. After its incorporation in 1875, wood-frame structures replaced the log cabins, and prosperous citizens built large houses around the developing government and business center. By 1900, as Orlando recovered from the economic disaster of the Great Freeze of 1894 and 1895, brick construction replaced wood frame as once pretentious houses close to the central city were torn down to make way for modern business blocks. As residences moved to less congested neighborhoods, schools and churches followed. From its beginning, people arrived in Orlando to prosper and build. Those men and their buildings are gone, but the history of the city is richer because of their presence. Orlando's story can be traced through the continuing cycle of constructing, demolishing, and rebuilding anew.","['Stephanie Gaub Antequino', 'Tana Mosier Porter', 'Historical Society of Central Florida']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4xWDRXbzXsMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4xWDRXbzXsMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Orlando+and+Orange+County+(Images+of+America+(Arcadia+Publishing))&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Arcadia Publishing,2012,http://books.google.com/books?id=4xWDRXbzXsMC&dq=Orlando+and+Orange+County+(Images+of+America+(Arcadia+Publishing))&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/951_Orlando_and_Orange_County__Images_of_America__Arcadia_Publishing__.jpg,History,1
An Imaginative Experience,"From the beloved British novelist, “a love story that’s simply, grandly, satisfying” (Kirkus Reviews). While traveling home to London, divorcé Sylvester Wykes witnesses a most unusual event: A woman leaps off a locomotive to rescue a sheep in distress. The mystery woman disappears, but Wykes cannot get her out of his head—and is soon caught up in the kind of romance he never thought he’d have again. Ever since losing her husband and child in one catastrophic night, Julia Piper has been consumed by guilt and loneliness. Her neighbors find her a bit odd—and after her daring attempt to save a sheep, she must somewhat agree. But as she strives to piece herself back together while taking on a job tending house for an enigmatic man, she comes to realize that perhaps her chance at finding happiness is not yet out of reach. “Wesley’s dialogue still comes bouncing off the page” in this charming, cynically romantic novel about the emotions, frailties, and desires that drive us, and the search for that one person who can make us whole (Publishers Weekly). “A complex, multilayered, love story . . . vintage Wesley.” —Kirkus Reviews",['Mary Wesley'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_X6NAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=_X6NAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=An+Imaginative+Experience&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2013-11-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_X6NAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],6.0,book_covers/30_An_Imaginative_Experience.jpg,Fiction,0

Thirteen years ago, Lisbeth made an impossible decision—leave third-century Carthage and her husband Cyprian behind for good. She knew it was to protect her daughter Maggie, so Lisbeth gathered the strength to move on with her life. All these years, Lisbeth has thrown herself into her work and raising her headstrong daughter, all to live up to the promise she made to Cyprian. But Maggie is sick of being protected.

Liquid Life: Abortion and Buddhism in Japan,"Why would a country strongly influenced by Buddhism's reverence for life allow legalized, widely used abortion?

After the Rains (Beneath a Southern Sky Series #2),"Long ago, Natalie’s mother faced an agonizing choice between the two people she loved most, and the difficult resolution to her predicament affects Natalie throughout her young life–fueling a season of teenage rebellion that results in the death of her best friend. As a young woman, Natalie attempts to put her troubles behind her, ultimately finding solace in the arms of a man with close ties to the tragedy. Yet neither time nor love can liberate her from the past. Determined to confront her terrible guilt, Natalie embarks on a journey that will take her thousands of miles from home and straight into the life and heart of a man unlike any she has ever known. Confronted with a decision that echoes the one her mother faced so many years before, Natalie finds herself drawn to two men–each of whom holds a claim to her heart. But the sins of her past must be confronted, and an escape from her guilt found, before her heart will be free to find its home. Showing that God can forgive the gravest of sins, After the Rains beautifully illustrates that his forgiveness comes purely through loving mercy and grace, not by our human efforts to earn it.

The Turks Today,"Eighty years have passed since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk founded the Turkish Republic out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire and set it on the path of modernisation. He was determined that his country should be accepted as a member of the family of civilised nations. Today Turkey is a rapidly developing country, an emergent market and a medium-sized regional power with the second strongest army in NATO. It is an open country which attracts millions of tourists, thousands of foreign businessmen and hundreds of researchers. They enjoy Turkish hospitality and experience its rich landscape and history, but many find it hard to form an overall picture of the country. In this sequel to his acclaimed biography of Ataturk, Andrew Mango provides such an overall portrait, tracing the republic's development since the death of its founder and bringing to life the Turkish people and their vibrant society.

Detective Agency: Women Rewriting the Hard-Boiled Tradition,"Since the late 1970s, a subgenre of crime fiction, written by women and featuring a professional woman investigator, has exploded on the popular fiction market. Priscilla L. Walton and Manina Jones focus on this recent proliferation of women writers of detective fiction, providing the first book-length study of the historical and societal changes that fueled this popularity, along with insightful and entertaining readings of the texts themselves. Walton and Jones place the genre within its aesthetic, social, and economic contexts, reading it as an index of cultural beliefs. Addressing the ways that Sara Paretsky, Sue Grafton, Marcia Muller, and others work through the conventions of the ""hard-boiled"" genre made popular by writers such as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Mickey Spillane, the authors show how the male hard-boiled tradition has been challenged and transformed. Issues of child, spousal, and sexual abuse are more likely to surface in women's detective novels, the authors show, and female sleuths face many of the same dilemmas as those who read about them—everyday problems with relationships, parenting, and money.

See Jane Run,"Jane Whittaker finds herself on a downtown street, her pockets stuffed with a large number of crisp $100 bills, the front of her dress soaked with blood. She has no idea of her identity. After a terrifying night of hiding, Jane ends up in hospital. There, while undergoing a battery of medical tests, she is recognized by one of the nurses. Soon her husband comes to claim her. He is every woman’s dream: popular, respected, wealthy, a tall blond doctor. He takes Jane home and vows to cure her with loving care and modern medicine. But Jane doesn’t get any better. The medication seems to be turning her into a zombie, and she begins to feel that her private nurse is holding her a virtual prisoner in her own home, isolating her from friends who might help her recover. Can Jane remember her past in time… in time to stop whatever it is that is happening to her, whatever made her lose her memory in the first place, whatever is trying to destroy her and her family?...",['Joy Fielding'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=REgPpmJmVOEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=REgPpmJmVOEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=See+Jane+Run&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Seal Books,2010-12-10,http://books.google.com/books?id=REgPpmJmVOEC&dq=See+Jane+Run&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],4.0,book_covers/53_See_Jane_Run.jpg,Fiction,0
"The Book of Hiding: Gender, Ethnicity, Annihilation, and Esther (Biblical Limits)","The Book of Hiding offers a fluent and erudite analysis of the parallels between the Bible and contemporary discussions of gender, ethnicity and social ambiguity. Beal focuses particularly on the traditionally marginalised book of Esther, in order to examine closely the categories of self and other in relation to religion, sexism, nationalism, and the ever-looming legacies and future possibilities of annihilation. Beal applies the critical tools of contemporary theorists, such as Cixous, Irigaray and Levinas, challenging widely held assumptions about the moral and life-affirming message of Scripture and even about the presence of God in the book of Esther. The Book of Hiding draws together a variety of different perspectives and disciplines, creating a unique space for dialogue raising new questions and reconsidering old assumptions, which is profoundly interesting and well-articulated.",['Timothy K.

The Valley of Vision,"The strength of Puritan character and life lay in prayer and meditation. In this practice the spirit of prayer was regarded as of first importance and the best form of prayer, for living prayer is the characteristic of genuine spirituality. Yet prayer is also vocal and may therefore on occasions be written. Consequently in the Puritan tradition there are many written prayers and meditations which constitute an important corpus of inspiring devotional literature. Too often ex tempore prayer lacks variety, order and definiteness. The reason for this lies partly in a neglect of due preparation. It is here that the care and scriptural thoroughness which others found necessary in their approach to God may be of help. This book has been prepared not to 'supply' prayers but to prompt and encourage the Christian as he treads the path on which others have gone before.",['Arthur Bennett'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l_AdAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=l_AdAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Valley+of+Vision&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Banner of Truth,2003-03-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=l_AdAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Valley+of+Vision&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],143.0,book_covers/593_The_Valley_of_Vision.jpg,Religion,2
The Soviet Mafia,"The first English-language book to document the men who emerged from the gulags to become Russia's much-feared crime class: the vory v zakone Mark Galeotti is the go-to expert on organized crime in Russia, consulted by governments and police around the world. Now, Western readers can explore the fascinating history of the vory v zakone, a group that has survived and thrived amid the changes brought on by Stalinism, the Cold War, the Afghan War, and the end of the Soviet experiment. The vory--as the Russian mafia is also known--was born early in the twentieth century, largely in the Gulags and criminal camps, where they developed their unique culture. Identified by their signature tattoos, members abided by the thieves' code, a strict system that forbade all paid employment and cooperation with law enforcement and the state.

The Mozarabs (the term may mean """"Arabized"""") of Toledo maintained their Catholic identity through the period of Islamic rule.

By returning to the moment when the scandal of empire became acceptable, we gain a new understanding of the modern culture of the colonizer and the colonized and the manifold implications for Britain, India, and the world.",['Nicholas B Dirks'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xiPd26ngXLkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xiPd26ngXLkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Scandal+of+Empire&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harvard University Press,2009-06-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xiPd26ngXLkC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/750_Scandal_of_Empire.jpg,History,1

A Horseman Riding By,"This saga of war and family from a New York Times–bestselling author is “sheer, wonderful storytelling” (Chicago Tribune). Spanning six decades, these three novels follow a man and his family as they struggle to adapt to life in a new world. From the death of Queen Victoria through the swinging sixties, this acclaimed saga is an unforgettable story of a farming family and a vanishing way of life. Long Summer Day: Lt. Paul Craddock returns to England after the Boer War to resume civilian life. His father has died, leaving Craddock heir to a scrap-metal business. But instead of continuing the family business, he purchases an auctioned-off thirteen-hundred-acre estate, Shallowford, where he will be changed by his love for two women: fiercely independent Grace Lovell and lovely, demure Claire Derwent. Post of Honour: Through hard work and love of the land, Craddock has transformed his sprawling estate and enjoys a peaceful country life with his wife and three children. But war has begun its inevitable march across England, and this remote corner of Devon cannot escape its destruction. As the Great War ends and another threatens to erupt, Craddock’s faith and the strength he derives from his family must sustain him and his village through trying, tumultuous times. The Green Gauntlet: Though Craddock’s village has endured despite the sorrows of war, he has new perils to face. Emerging property laws threaten his livelihood, dividing his family over the future of his beloved Shallowford. For his sons and daughter, the fifties and sixties will be a time of discovery and change that will resonate in the lives of their own children.",['R. F.

A Conspiracy of Nations,"Why are Americans today so fascinated by the X-Files? How did rumors emerge about the origins of the AIDS virus as a weapon of biowarfare? Why does the Kennedy assassination provoke heated debate nearly forty years after the fact, and what do we make of Hillary Clinton's accusation of a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" against her husband? The origins of these ideas reveal important facets of American culture and politics. Placing conspiracy thinking at the center of American history, and challenging the knee-jerk dismissal of conspiratorial thought as deluded and sometimes dangerous, Conspiracy Nation provides a wide-ranging survey of conspiracy theories in contemporary America. In the 19th century, inflammatory rhetoric about slave revolts, the well-publicized specter of the black rapist, and the formation of the Ku Klux Klan all worked as conspiracy theories to legitimate an emerging sense of national consciousness based on an ideology of white supremacy. Today, panicked responses to increasing multiculturalism and globalization yield new notions of victimhood and new theories about conspiratorial plans for global domination. Offering up a provocative array of examples, ranging from alien abduction to the novels of DeLillo and Pynchon to Tupac Shakur's ""paranoid style,"" Conspiracy Nation documents and unearths the workings of conspiracy in the contemporary moment. Their conclusions, sometimes startling and always compelling, have much to say about the nature of identity and anxiety, imagination and politics, and the state of the American psyche today.

"Gunnar's daughter,","The first historical novel by the Nobel Prize-winning author of Kristin Lavransdatter A Penguin Classic More than a decade before writing Kristin Lavransdatter, the trilogy about fourteenth-century Norway that won her the Nobel Prize, Sigrid Undset published Gunnar’s Daughter, a brief, swiftly moving tale about a more violent period of her country’s history, the Saga Age. Set in Norway and Iceland at the beginning of the eleventh century, Gunnar's Daughter is the story of the beautiful, spoiled Vigdis Gunnarsdatter, who is raped by the man she had wanted to love. A woman of courage and intelligence, Vigdis is toughened by adversity. Alone she raises the child conceived in violence, repeatedly defending her autonomy in a world governed by men. Alone she rebuilds her life and restores her family's honor—until an unremitting social code propels her to take the action that again destroys her happiness. First published in 1909, Gunnar's Daughter was in part a response to the rise of nationalism and Norway's search for a national identity in its Viking past. But unlike most of the Viking-inspired art of its period, Gunnar's Daughter is not a historical romance. It is a skillful conversation between two historical moments about questions as troublesome in Undset's own time—and in ours—as they were in the Saga Age: rape and revenge, civil and domestic violence, troubled marriages, and children made victims of their parents' problems.",['Sigrid Undset'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-gKeHlOdRD8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=-gKeHlOdRD8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Gunnar%27s+daughter,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Penguin,1998-04-01,"http://books.google.com/books?id=-gKeHlOdRD8C&dq=Gunnar%27s+daughter,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Fiction'],5.0,book_covers/97_Gunnar_s_daughter_.jpg,Fiction,0

A simple-minded kid nailed for the crime is the cousin of an old colleague of Sergeant Jim Chee. He needs help and Chee, and his fiancée Bernie Manuelito, decide to provide it. Proving the kid's innocence requires finding the remains of one of 172 people whose bodies were scattered among the cliffs of the Grand Canyon in an epic airline disaster 50 years in the past.

"Great Terror, the","The definitive work on Stalin's purges, the author's The Great Terror was universally acclaimed when it first appeared in 1968. It was ""hailed as the only scrupulous, nonpartisan, and adequate book on the subject"". And in recent years it has received equally high praise in the Soviet Union, where it is now considered the authority on the period, and has been serialized in Neva, one of their leading periodicals. Of course, when the author wrote the original volume two decades ago, he relied heavily on unofficial sources. Now, with the advent of glasnost, an avalanche of new material is available, and he has mined this enormous cache to write a substantially new edition of his classic work. It is remarkable how many of the most disturbing conclusions have born up under the light of fresh evidence. But the author has added enormously to the detail, including hitherto secret information on the three great ""Moscow Trials,"" on the fate of the executed generals, on the methods of obtaining confessions, on the purge of writers and other members of the intelligentsia, on life in the labor camps, and many other key matters. Both a leading Sovietologist and a highly respected poet, the author blends research with prose, providing not only an authoritative account of Stalin's purges, but also a compelling chronicle of one of this century's most tragic events.

"11 Days in December: Christmas at the Bulge, 1944","In 11 Days In December, master historian and biographer Stanley Weintraub tells the remarkable story of the Battle of the Bulge as it has never been told before, from frozen foxholes to barn shelters to boxcars packed with wretched prisoners of war. In late December 1944, as the Battle of the Bulge neared its climax, a German loudspeaker challenge was blared across GI lines in the Ardennes: ""How would you like to die for Christmas?"" In the inhospitable forest straddling Belgium, France, and Luxembourg, only the dense, snow-laden evergreens recalled the season. Most troops hardly knew the calendar day they were trying to live through, or that it was Hitler's last, desperate effort to alter the war's outcome. Yet the final Christmas season of World War II matched desperation with inspiration. When he was offered an ultimatum to surrender the besieged Belgian town of Bastogne, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe defied the Germans with the memorable one-word response, ""Nuts!"" And as General Patton prayed for clear skies to allow vital airborne reinforcements to reach his trapped men, he stood in a medieval chapel in Luxembourg and spoke to God as if to a commanding general: ""Sir, whose side are you on?"" His prayer was answered. The skies cleared, the tide of battle turned, and Allied victory in World War II was assured. Christmas 1944 proved to be one of the most fateful days in world history. Many men did extraordinary things, and extraordinary things happened to ordinary men. ""A clear cold Christmas,"" Patton told his diary, ""lovely weather for killing Germans, which seems a bit queer, seeing whose birthday it is."" Peace on earth and good will toward men would have to wait. 11 Days in December is unforgettable.",['Stanley Weintraub'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PWzwzSfNepcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=PWzwzSfNepcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=11+Days+in+December:+Christmas+at+the+Bulge,+1944&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Simon and Schuster,2006-11-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PWzwzSfNepcC&source=gbs_api,['History'],3.0,book_covers/939_11_Days_in_December__Christmas_at_the_Bulge__1944.jpg,History,1
Dubrovnik: A History,"Since emerging as a settlement in the seventh century, Dubrovnik has faced Venetian aggressors, Ottoman plotters, a terrible earthquake in 1667 and, finally, the will of Napoleon.

Expensive people,"Joyce Carol Oates’s Wonderland Quartet comprises four remarkable novels that explore social class in America and the inner lives of young Americans. In Expensive People, Oates takes a provocative and suspenseful look at the roiling secrets of America’s affluent suburbs. Set in the late 1960s, this first-person confession is narrated by Richard Everett, a precocious and obese boy who sees himself as a minor character in the alarming drama unfolding around him. Fascinated by yet alienated from his attractive, self-absorbed parents and the privileged world they inhabit, Richard incisively analyzes his own mismanaged childhood, his pretentious private schooling, his “successful-executive” father, and his elusive mother. In an act of defiance and desperation, eleven-year-old Richard strikes out in a way that presages the violence of ever-younger Americans in the turbulent decades to come. A National Book Award finalist, Expensive People is a stunning combination of social satire and gothic horror. “You cannot put this novel away after you have opened it,” said The Detroit News. “This is that kind of book–hypnotic, fascinating, and electrifying.” Expensive People is the second novel in the Wonderland Quartet. The books that complete this acclaimed series, A Garden of Earthly Delights, them, and Wonderland, are also available from the Modern Library.",['Joyce Carol Oates'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rh2SqsdOa5QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Rh2SqsdOa5QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Expensive+people&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Modern Library,2009-04-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rh2SqsdOa5QC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],9.0,book_covers/285_Expensive_people.jpg,Fiction,0

Assignment in Utopia,"This is a story of belief, disillusionment and atonement. Long identified with leftist causes, the journalist Eugene Lyons was by background and sentiment predisposed to early support of the Russian Revolution. A ""friendly correspondent,"" he was one of a coterie of foreign journalists permitted into the Soviet Union during the Stalinist era because their desire to serve the revolution was thought to outweigh their desire to serve the truth. Lyons first went to the Soviet Union in 1927, and spent six years there. He was there as Stalin consolidated his power, through collectivization and its consequences, as the cultural and technical intelligentsia succumbed to the secret police, and as the mechanisms of terror were honed. As Ellen Frankel Paul notes in her major new introduction to this edition, ""It was this murderous reality that Stalin's censors worked so assiduously to camouflage, corralling foreign correspondents as their often willing allies."" Lyons was one of those allies. Assignment in ""Utopia ""describes why he refused to see the obvious, the forces that kept him from writing the truth, and the tortuous path he traveled in liberating himself. His story helps us understand how so many who were in a position to know were so silent for so long. In addition, it is a document, by an on-the-scene journalist, of major events in the critical period of the first Five-Year Plan. As Ellen Frankel Paul notes in her major new introduction to this new edition, Assignment in ""Utopia ""is particularly timely. The system it dissects in such devastating detail is in the process of being rejected throughout Eastern Europe and is under challenge in the Soviet Union itself. The book lends insight into the ""political pilgrim"" phenomenon described by Paul Hollander, in which visitors celebrate terrorist regimes, seemingly oblivious to their destructive force. The book is valuable for those interested in the Stalinist era in the Soviet Union, those interested in radical regimes and political change, as well as those interested in better understanding current events in Europe. It will also be useful for the tough questions it poses about journalistic ethics.",['Eugene Lyons'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Assignment+in+Utopia&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Transaction Publishers,1938,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/839_Assignment_in_Utopia.jpg,History,1
Civil War on the Western Border 1854-1865,"The first phase of the Civil War was fought west of the Mississippi River at least six years before the attack on Fort Sumter. Starting with the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, Jay Monaghan traces the development of the conflict between the pro-slavery elements from Missouri and the New England abolitionists who migrated to Kansas. ""Bleeding Kansas"" provided a preview of the greater national struggle to come. The author allows a new look at Quantrill's sacking of Lawrence, organized bushwhackery, and border battles that cost thousands of lives. Not the least valuable are chapters on the American Indians’ part in the conflict. The record becomes devastatingly clear: the fighting in the West was the cruelest and most useless of the whole affair, and if men of vision had been in Washington in the 1850s it might have been avoided.",['Jay Monaghan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8y4yLq1CF40C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8y4yLq1CF40C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Civil+War+on+the+Western+Border+1854-1865&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,U of Nebraska Press,1955-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=8y4yLq1CF40C&dq=Civil+War+on+the+Western+Border+1854-1865&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0,book_covers/850_Civil_War_on_the_Western_Border_1854-1865.jpg,History,1

Beneath The Moors and Darker Places,"In addition to his stellar Necroscope series, Brian Lumley is highly regarded for his short fiction, for which he has won the British Fantasy Award. Beneath the Moors and Darker Places, a companion to The Whisperer and Other Voices, collects nine lengthy exemplars of the best of Lumley's short works, many of them unavailable for decades in any form. The Cthulhu Mythos of the immortal H.P. Lovecraft provides inspiration for much of Lumley's work, including ""Dagon's Bell"" and ""Big C,"" both included here. The explosive creation of a new volcanic island off Iceland in 1967 led to ""Rising with Surtsey,"" a homage not just to Lovecraft but to the great August Derleth. ""David's Worm""--which takes an interesting view of ""you are what you eat""--was published in a Year's Best Horror Stories and later adapted for radio in Europe. The collection also includes the macabre ""The Second Wish,"" published here for the first time with the author's original, intended ending, and ""The Fairground Horror,"" first published in The Disciples of Cthulhu twenty-five years ago and not seen since save for a small press edition. The title tale, Beneath the Moors, a complete short novel, has been unavailable in the United States since its first publication by Arkham House in the early 1970s. It is considered to be one of Lumley's strongest short works; Tor is proud to restore this and the other pieces in this volume to Lumley's growing readership.

"Primitive Christianity in its contemporary setting (Living age books, LA 4)","Virtually all scholars agree that Jesus did one very risky thing: he exorcised demons. Exorcism was an illicit activity in the Roman world, so why would Jesus risk condemnation, arrest, and even death for the sake of the demon-possessed? Some point to his compassion. Roger Busse, a thirty-nine-year veteran of risk analysis and a graduate of Harvard Divinity School, has another answer from the world in which he lives: risk assessment. People engage in risky ventures only when not doing so would pose even greater risks. What was the greater risk for Jesus? He believed that his land and home, then suffering under foreign occupation, was filled with demons. He believed that if he did not drive them off, all might be lost and the forces of darkness might win out, leaving only the kingdom of Satan. Given this context, Busse reassesses the gospel traditions. Using risk analysis, Busse provides a new approach that recovers the specific charismatic practices, sayings, and parables that the exorcist Jesus' employed in his deliberate and dangerous strategy to drive Satan from the land and reestablish the kingdom of God. To Be Near the Fire offers a new portrait of Jesus and the origins of Christianity.",['Roger S.

A Match Made in Scandal (Donally Family),"An obsession that blooms into scandal Since childhood, Ryan Donally adored Rachel Bailey, though the brilliant, beautiful lass saw him as just another rowdy boy. The years pulled them apart, carrying Rachel to a place of responsibility and respect few women of her time enjoyed . . . while Ryan ascended to undreamed-of heights of wealth and success, and bound his heart to another. Now fate has brought them together once again—and Rachel sees not the boy she once spurned, but a breathtaking man she desires. Yet Ryan has moved on and is unwilling to forgive, and Rachel hides a secret shame that could destroy everything she has worked for.

Tagebuch im Kriege: A Diary of WWI Rumania,"This book puts German policy toward Romania and the German East into a global context. One of the signal events of the twentieth century was Germany's effort to construct an empire in Europe modeled on the European experience outside Europe. The turn to European empire resulted less from the dynamics of capitalist expansion than from a deep crisis in global political and economic order. Confronted with the global economic and political power of the western allies, the Germans turned to Eastern Europe to construct a dependent space, tied to Germany as Central America was to the US. The First World War transformed how Germans thought about international order, empire and the nature of Romanians. The domestic consequences of Germany's eviction from global markets authorized deep interventions in Romanian society to establish a pre-eminent position for the German state inside Romania.

On the other end of the phone is Caroline’s daughter, Kay, a public defender like her father, sobbing at the improbably good news that the richest, most eligible boy in Raleigh, North Carolina, has asked her to marry him. While Caroline and Tom are trying to digest this, the other phone, the “children’s line,” rings; it is Caroline’s sister, Taffy, hysterical over her husband’s decision to leave her for a woman two years younger than her daughter. Soon Taffy is wending her way up from Atlanta to seek solace in her sister’s home, even though the two have been separated by more than just geography for the past forty years. With her is her little dog, Stamp, who has a penchant for biting ankles and stealing hearts. Tom and Caroline quickly realize that the wedding their future son-in-law’s family is envisioning for nine-hundred-plus guests is to be their fiscal responsibility. To top it all off, the foundation of their home is in danger of collapsing and their contractor and his crew have all but moved in. It’s a thundering whirlwind of emotion that finally boils down to: Who is in love with whom? and Who’s going to get the next dance?

In 1910, while hiking through the wild lavender in a wind-swept, desolate valley in Provence, a man comes across a shepherd called Elzéard Bouffier. Staying with him, he watches Elzéard sorting and then planting hundreds of acorns as he walks through the wilderness. Ten years later, after surviving the First World War, he visits the shepherd again and sees the young forest he has created spreading slowly over the valley.

Pride of Lions,"Lion of Ireland was the breathtaking chronicle of Brian Boru, the Great King who led the bickering chiefs of Ireland to unity under his reign. He overthrew traditions, reformed society, and became the Irish Charlemagne. The Ireland of 1014 was a dream Brian Boru had dreamed and brought into being. Now, with all the fire and brilliance for which her writing is known, Morgan Llywelyn takes us there, to the battlefield where Brian died, and to Brian's fifteen-year-old son, Donough, whose mother is the voluptuous and treacherous Gormlaith, with her lust for life and power undiminished by age: Donough, the son who is determined to make the High Kingship of Brian Boru's Ireland his own. ""I know he's too young, but he's all we have left,"" says Fergal, and thus the boy takes his first command, on the bloody ground of Clontarf. From there he must move to establish his right to rule in Kincora and to make the kings of Ireland accept him as their High King. Yet Donough is torn--torn by his hatred for his mother and by his all-consuming passion for the beautiful pagan girl Cera, who remains beyond his reach, for the High King must have a Christian consort....

Antisemitism and Modernity: Innovation and Continuity (Routledge Jewish Studies Series),"The subject of anti-Semitism, not long ago thought to be a dead issue, has been revised due to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Maccoby traces the now topical discussion of the origins of Anti-Semitism, and especially its development in the modern world. The key questions that are addressed include: How is it that this medieval prejudice proved so lasting and potent? Are the roots of anti-Semitism religious? If so, how do these roots differ in Christianity and Islam? By what means did it bridge the gap between medievalism and Enlightenment? How was it that many of the most respected Enlightenment figures (such as Voltaire) dedicated as they were to tolerance and pluralism, retained a virulent anti-Semitism? These questions, and many more, are dealt with as Maccoby explores the roots of the anti-Semitism, tracing it from its origins, and shows how it has changed in accordance with the shifting ideas of the modern world but without changing in its essence. Antisemitism and Modernity is essential reading for those with interests in the development of anti-Semitism, its manifestation in the current world and its future.",['Hyam Maccoby'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ub6EbnopW7cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ub6EbnopW7cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Antisemitism+and+Modernity:+Innovation+and+Continuity+(Routledge+Jewish+Studies+Series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2006-02-14,http://books.google.com/books?id=ub6EbnopW7cC&dq=Antisemitism+and+Modernity:+Innovation+and+Continuity+(Routledge+Jewish+Studies+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/669_Antisemitism_and_Modernity__Innovation_and_Continuity__Routledge_Jewish_Studies_Series_.jpg,History,1

Six-foot-tall, redheaded ex-cop and Boston-based private eye Carlotta Carlyle is “the genuine article: a straightforward, funny, thoroughly American mystery heroine” (New York Post).

Knee-Deep in Wonder: A Novel,"A dazzling first novel about four generations of fear and longing in the deep South ""Who're your people, girl?"" It's the song of the South, the big question, persistent and unforgiving. Helene Strickland, daughter of Lafayette County, Arkansas, and lately of the Northeast, doesn't have an answer. Instead, she has memories riddled with half-truths, stories heard in fits and starts, a family history from a family that doesn't know its own past. In the steamy August of 1976, Helene returns home for her aunt's funeral determined to learn the truth, but her probing yields more questions than answers: Why did her grandmother, Liberty, a cotton picker turned saloon owner, have no name until she was fourteen? Why does Queen Ester, Helene's mother, dress like a child, talk to no one, and refuse to see her own daughter? And who was Chess, a man with a terror of water, a man like a honey trap who drew the women and then destroyed them?

At first he resists the LAPD shrink, but finally recognizes that something is troubling him and has for a long time.

Mr. Lincoln's army,"A vivid account of the early battles, first in the Pulitzer Prize-winning trilogy: “One of America’s foremost Civil War authorities” (Kirkus Reviews). The first book in Bruce Catton’s Pulitzer Prize–winning Army of the Potomac Trilogy, Mr. Lincoln’s Army is a riveting history of the early years of the Civil War, when a fledgling Union Army took its stumbling first steps under the command of the controversial general George McClellan. Following the secession of the Southern states, a beleaguered President Abraham Lincoln entrusted the dashing, charismatic McClellan with the creation of the Union’s Army of the Potomac and the responsibility of leading it to a swift and decisive victory against Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. Although a brilliant tactician who was beloved by his troops and embraced by the hero-hungry North, McClellan’s ego and ambition ultimately put him at loggerheads with his commander in chief—a man McClellan considered unworthy of the presidency. McClellan’s weaknesses were exposed during the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American military history, which ended in a stalemate even though the Confederate troops were greatly outnumbered. After Antietam, Lincoln ordered McClellan’s removal from command, and the Union entered the war’s next chapter having suffered thousands of casualties and with great uncertainty ahead. America’s premier chronicler of the nation’s brutal internecine conflict, Bruce Catton is renowned for his unparalleled ability to bring a detailed and vivid immediacy to Civil War battlefields and military strategy sessions. With tremendous depth and insight, he presents legendary commanders and common soldiers in all their complex and heartbreaking humanity.",['Bruce Catton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PVuMCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PVuMCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mr.+Lincoln%27s+army&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2015-11-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PVuMCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],7.0,book_covers/888_Mr__Lincoln_s_army.jpg,History,1

The outbreak of rebellion (Campaigns of the Civil War),"John G. Nicolay (1832–1901) was an undeniably apt and brilliant choice to inaugurate the landmark Campaigns of the Civil War series. Private secretary to President Lincoln and coauthor (with John Hay) of the monumental, ten-volume Lincoln biography, Nicolay experienced the Civil War from a unique vantage point: living in the White House, witnessing the many momentous events and minor wranglings, sharing the nation's trauma with Lincoln, and winning his open confidence. It is Nicolay's firsthand knowledge and personal observations of the key figures that imbue The Outbreak of Rebellion (1881) with immediacy and thrust. Here is the secession fever that swept the South; Lincoln's shrewd and desperate maneuverings to hold the border states; the behind-the-scenes debates about how to respond to the crisis; the attack on Fort Sumter and the call to arms; and the hard-fought battle along Bull Run creek that resulted in a chaotic Federal defeat and the first appalling casualties of the war. Nicolay's insider view of the opening act of the Civil War has produced a succinct, compelling account of considerable value and fascinating insights.",['John G.

"Proudly We Can Be Africans: Black Americans and Africa, 1935-1961","The mid-twentieth century witnessed nations across Africa fighting for their independence from colonial forces. By examining black Americans' attitudes toward and responses to these liberation struggles, James Meriwether probes the shifting meaning of Africa in the intellectual, political, and social lives of African Americans. Paying particular attention to such important figures and organizations as W. E. B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King Jr., and the NAACP, Meriwether incisively utilizes the black press, personal correspondence, and oral histories to render a remarkably nuanced and diverse portrait of African American opinion. Meriwether builds the book around seminal episodes in modern African history, including nonviolent protests against apartheid in South Africa, the Mau Mau war in Kenya, Ghana's drive for independence under Kwame Nkrumah, and Patrice Lumumba's murder in the Congo. Viewing these events within the context of their own changing lives, especially in regard to the U.S. civil rights struggle, African Americans have continually reconsidered their relationship to contemporary Africa and vigorously debated how best to translate their concerns into action in the international arena. Grounded in black Americans' encounters with Africa, this transnational history sits astride the leading issues of the twentieth century: race, civil rights, anticolonialism, and the intersections of domestic race relations and U.S. foreign relations.",['James H.

War Fever,"A ""marvelous"" (Sports Illustrated) portrait of the three men whose lives were forever changed by WWI-era Boston and the Spanish flu: baseball star Babe Ruth, symphony conductor Karl Muck, and Harvard law student Charles Whittlesey. In the fall of 1918, a fever gripped Boston. The streets emptied as paranoia about the deadly Spanish flu spread. Newspapermen and vigilante investigators aggressively sought to discredit anyone who looked or sounded German. And as the war raged on, the enemy seemed to be lurking everywhere: prowling in submarines off the coast of Cape Cod, arriving on passenger ships in the harbor, or disguised as the radicals lecturing workers about the injustice of a sixty-hour workweek. War Fever explores this delirious moment in American history through the stories of three men: Karl Muck, the German conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, accused of being an enemy spy; Charles Whittlesey, a Harvard law graduate who became an unlikely hero in Europe; and the most famous baseball player of all time, Babe Ruth, poised to revolutionize the game he loved. Together, they offer a gripping narrative of America at war and American culture in upheaval.","['Randy Roberts', 'Johnny Smith']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IIuhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=IIuhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=War+Fever&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette UK,2020-03-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IIuhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0,book_covers/675_War_Fever.jpg,History,1

Zimbabwe,"The first single-volume history of Zimbabwe with detailed coverage from pre-colonial times to the present, this book examines Zimbabwe's pre-colonial, colonial and postcolonial social, economic and political history and relates historical factors and trends to recent developments in the country. Zimbabwe is a country with a rich history, dating from the early San hunter-gatherer societies. The arrival of British imperial rule in 1890 impacted the country tremendously, as the European rulers exploited Zimbabwe's resources, giving rise to a movement of African nationalism and demands for independence. This culminated in the armed conflict of the 1960s and 1970s and independence in 1980. The 1990s were marked by economic decline and the rise of opposition politics. In 1999, Mugabe embarked on a violent land reform program that plunged the nation's economy into a downward spiral, with political violence and human rights violations making Zimbabwe an international pariah state. This book will be useful to those studying Zimbabwean history and those unfamiliar with the country's past.",['Alois S.

The Big Idea of Biblical Preaching: Connecting the Bible to People,"Since 1980, Haddon Robinson has influenced generations of students and preachers through his widely used classic text, Biblical Preaching, in which he shows preachers how to communicate the Bible's big ideas with precision.

With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa,"“Eugene Sledge became more than a legend with his memoir, With The Old Breed. He became a chronicler, a historian, a storyteller who turns the extremes of the war in the Pacific—the terror, the camaraderie, the banal and the extraordinary—into terms we mortals can grasp.”—Tom Hanks NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER In The Wall Street Journal, Victor Davis Hanson named With the Old Breed one of the top five books on epic twentieth-century battles. Studs Terkel interviewed the author for his definitive oral history, The Good War. Now E. B. Sledge’s acclaimed first-person account of fighting at Peleliu and Okinawa returns to thrill, edify, and inspire a new generation. An Alabama boy steeped in American history and enamored of such heroes as George Washington and Daniel Boone, Eugene B. Sledge became part of the war’s famous 1st Marine Division—3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. Even after intense training, he was shocked to be thrown into the battle of Peleliu, where “the world was a nightmare of flashes, explosions, and snapping bullets.” By the time Sledge hit the hell of Okinawa, he was a combat vet, still filled with fear but no longer with panic. Based on notes Sledge secretly kept in a copy of the New Testament, With the Old Breed captures with utter simplicity and searing honesty the experience of a soldier in the fierce Pacific Theater. Here is what saved, threatened, and changed his life. Here, too, is the story of how he learned to hate and kill—and came to love—his fellow man. “In all the literature on the Second World War, there is not a more honest, realistic or moving memoir than Eugene Sledge’s. This is the real deal, the real war: unvarnished, brutal, without a shred of sentimentality or false patriotism, a profound primer on what it actually was like to be in that war. It is a classic that will outlive all the armchair generals’ safe accounts of—not the ‘good war’—but the worst war ever.”—Ken Burns",['E.B.

"Bloody Shambles, Vol. 1: The Drift to War to the fall of Singapore","Shortly after midnight on 8 December 1941, two divisions of crack troops of the Imperial Japanese Army began a seaborne invasion of southern Thailand and northern Malaya. Their assault developed into a full-blown advance towards Singapore, the main defensive position of the British Empire in the Far East. The defending British, Indian, Australian and Malayan forces were outmanoeuvred on the ground, overwhelmed in the air and scattered on the sea. By the end of January 1942, British Empire forces were driven back onto the island of Singapore Itself, cut off from further outside help. When the Japanese stormed the island with an an-out assault, the defenders were quickly pushed back into a corner from which there was no escape. Singapore’s defenders finally capitulated on 15 February, to prevent the wholesale pillage of the city itself. Their rapid and total defeat was nothing less than military humiliation and political disaster. Based on the most extensive use yet of primary documents in Britain, Japan, Australia and Singapore, Brian Farrell provides the fullest picture of how and why Singapore fell and its real significance to the outcome of the Second World War.",['Brian Farrell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rh7fDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=rh7fDQAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA90&dq=Bloody+Shambles,+Vol.+1:+The+Drift+to+War+to+the+fall+of+Singapore&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Monsoon Books,2017-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rh7fDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/869_Bloody_Shambles__Vol__1__The_Drift_to_War_to_the_fall_of_Singapore.jpg,History,1

By what authority?,"In this newly updated, expanded version of his popular work of apologetics, Shea presents a lively and entertaining look at his conversion to Catholicism from Evangelicalism and his discovery of Christian tradition. As an Evangelical, Shea accepted the principle of ""sola scriptura"" (Scripture alone) as the basis of faith. Now as a Catholic convert, he skillfully explains how and why Sacred Tradition occupies a central role in Divine Revelation. Tracing his own journey of intellectual and spiritual awakening, Shea begins by looking for a rejoinder to those modern-day false prophets who would claim that Scripture itself is not to be trusted, and ends with his conviction that tradition, as explained by the Catholic Church, is the only sure guarantee of the truth of the revelation of Jesus Christ.

These new translations of the thirteenth-century Zen master Dogenandmdash;one of most original and important Zen writersandmdash;illustrate the rational side of Zen, which has been obscured through the centuries, tainting people's understanding of it. Rational Zen consists of enlightening selections from Dogen's two masterworks, andquot;Treasury of Eyes of True Teachingandquot; (the famed Shobogenzo, Japan's most sophisticated philosophical work) and andquot;Universal Book of Eternal Peace,andquot; which until now has been unavailable in English. The translator also provides explanations of the inner meanings of Dogen's writings and sayingsandmdash;the first commentaries of their kind of English.

"Splendid Land, Splendid People: The Chickasaw Indians to Removal","Before the Chickasaws were removed to lands in Oklahoma in the 1800s, the heart of the Chickasaw Nation was located east of the Mississippi River in the upper watershed of the Tombigbee River in what is today northeastern Mississippi. Their lands had been called ""splendid and fertile"" by French governor Bienville at the time they were being coveted by early European settlers. The people were also termed ""splendid"" and described by documents of the 1700s as ""tall, well made, and of an unparalleled courage. . . . The men have regular features, well shaped and neatly dressed; they are fierce, and have a high opinion of themselves."" The progenitors of the sociopolitical entity termed by European chroniclers progressively as Chicasa, Chicaca, Chicacha, Chicasaws, and finally Chickasaw may have migrated from west of the Mississippi River in prehistoric times. Or migrating people may have joined indigenous populations. Despite this longevity in their ancestral lands, the Chickasaw were the only one of the original ""five civilized tribes"" to leave no remnant community in the Southeast at the time of removal. Atkinson thoroughly researches the Chickasaw Indians, tracing their history as far back as the documentation and archaeological record will allow. He historicizes from a Native viewpoint and outlines political events leading to removal, while addressing important issues such as slave-holding among Chickasaws, involvement of Chickasaw and neighboring Indian tribes in the American Revolution, and the lives of Chickasaw women. Splendid Land, Splendid People will become a fundamental resource for current information and further research on the Chickasaw. A wide audience of librarians, anthropologists, historians, and general readers have long awaited publication of this important volume.",['James R.

"Seeking the High Yellow Note: Vincent Van Gogh in Provence, a Novel","Imagine sitting in a blossoming orchard beside an unknown Vincent van Gogh, watching him paint as he talks of his hopes, his dreams. Minette Ginoux, a young Arlesienne, befriends him when he arrives during a February snowstorm and quickly becomes his confidant. The friendship deepens, but dark clouds threaten this arcadia as Minette discovers Vincents secret moods and habits which shock and repel. The arrival of Paul Gauguin precipitates a string of disasters affecting them both when conflicts erupt between the two men. Set in a land of idyllic natural beauty, the novel describes the art of van Gogh at its most compelling and reveals a young girls deepest feelings for the artist. Aunt Titi, sister Colette, handsome Etienne Martin who is seeking a wife, the townspeople of Arles, mingle in a rich and suspense- filled drama celebrating the struggles of a gifted yet tormented painter. READING GROUP GUIDE for Seeking the High Yellow Note, Vincent Van Gogh in Provence 1. Seeking the High Yellow Note is a novel about the artist Vincent Van Gogh told by Minette Ginoux, a young girl living in Arles with whom he shares a friendship. Set in Provence, during his most productive artistic period, the novel describes the setting and his works in rich detail. Discuss some of the reasons why Van Gogh flourished as a painter in this setting. 2. Through Van Goghs interaction with Minette and the people around him, the personality of the artist is revealed. Vincent tells Minette of his previous failed attempts to succeed in a relationship with women. (See p. 51). Why do you think he was successful in forming a friendship with Minette? 3. It becomes quickly apparent to the reader how dependent Vincent became on the support of his brother Theo, both financially and emotionally. Would you describe such a close bond with a sibling usual or unusual within the bonds of family? Why? Do you think Vincent could have painted as he did without his brothers support? 4. The arrival of Paul Gauguin is fully described in the book (p. 81). What did Gauguin contribute to Van Gogh in furthering his painting? What responsibility does he bear for Vincents decline and illness? Discuss differences in painting techniques of the two artists. 5. Follow the development of the friendship between Minette and Etienne Martin, the young joiner from Nimes. At what point does she give up the possibility of Vincent as a suitor? (See p. 75). Vincent painted The Girl with Coffee Tinted Skin (Minette) and The Young Frenchman of Modern Times (Etienne). Discuss the friendship of Vincent and Etienne. 6. When Vincent speaks of The High Yellow Note in his painting, what does he mean? (p. 126). 7. The book is meant to give a picture of life in Provence in the late 1800s. What was your feeling about farm life as described by Minette on the Martin mas, or farm? Minette and her sister Colette worked as waitresses in the cafe of their Aunt Titi in the town of Arles. How was their life different from that of young girls today? 8. In 1889 Vincent voluntarily entered the asylum at Saint Remy, hoping to receive treatment for his illness. Minette paid one visit to him during this time (p. 175). How would you describe the asylum and the treatment Vincent received there? What caused Vincents illness? Several possibilities have been mentioned, but no conclusions drawn (p.183). 9. Vincent Van Gogh sold only one painting during his lifetime, The Red Vineyard, now in the Pushkin Museum, Moscow. (See p. 99). What do you think was the reason for this? Why did sales of his paintings begin so soon after his death? What was the effect of his death on Minette and Etienne?

The Salish People and the Lewis and Clark Expedition,"On September 4, 1805, in the upper Bitterroot Valley of what is now western Montana, more than four hundred Salish people were encamped, pasturing horses, preparing for the fall bison hunt, and harvesting chokecherries as they had done for countless generations. As the Lewis and Clark Expedition ventured into the territory of a sovereign Native nation, the Salish met the strangers with hospitality and vital provisions while receiving comparatively little in return. ø For the first time, a Native American community offers an in-depth examination of the events and historical significance of its encounter with the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The Salish People and the Lewis and Clark Expedition is a startling departure from previous accounts of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Rather than looking at Indian people within the context of the expedition, it examines the expedition within the context of tribal history. The arrival of non-Indians is therefore framed not as the beginning of the history of Montana or the West but as only a recent chapter in a far longer Native history. The result is a new understanding of the expedition and its place in the wider context of the history of Indian-white relations. ø Based on three decades of research and oral histories, this book presents tribal elders recounting the Salish encounter with Lewis and Clark. Richly illustrated, The Salish People and the Lewis and Clark Expedition not only sheds new light on the meaning of the expedition but also illuminates the people who greeted Lewis and Clark and, despite much of what followed, thrive in their homeland today.","[""Salish-Pend D'Oreille Culture Committee"", 'Elders Cultural Advisory Council', 'Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cbExZ5YqpgwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cbExZ5YqpgwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Salish+People+and+the+Lewis+and+Clark+Expedition&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,U of Nebraska Press,2008-07-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=cbExZ5YqpgwC&dq=The+Salish+People+and+the+Lewis+and+Clark+Expedition&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0,book_covers/972_The_Salish_People_and_the_Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition.jpg,History,1

"Wars of the Irish Kings: A Thousand Years of Struggle, from the Age of Myth through the Reign of Queen Elizabeth I","For the first thousand years of its history, Ireland was shaped by its monasteries and its wars. The artistic flourishing of the monasteries has received a good deal of attention, but the violent and varied wars have in recent years gone unremembered. In Wars of the Irish Kings, David Willis McCullough has turned back to the earliest accounts of these struggles to present a rich tapestry of Ireland's fight for its identity. Beginning with the legends of ancient wars and warriors, moving through a time when history and storytelling were not separate crafts, into a time when history was as much propaganda as fact, Wars of the Irish Kings tells of tribal battles, foreign invasions, Viking raids, family feuds, wars between rival Irish kingdoms, and wars of rebellion against the English. This collection is peopled with familiar names: Cuchulain, Finn MacCool, Brian Boru, Mad King Sweeney, Strongbow, Edward and Robert Bruce, Queen Elizabeth I and Lord Essex, Hugh O'Donnell, and Hugh O'Neill. Battles formed the legends and history of the land: the Da Dannan meet the Fir Bolgs near Sligo, Brian Boru faces the Vikings at Clontarf in Dublin Bay, High King Rory O'Connor confronts the English invaders near Waterford, O'Briens battle the English (and other O'Briens) at Dysert O'Dea near Limerick, guns are carried for the first time in battle at Knockdoe near Galway, the Bruces from Scotland and their Irish allies overwhelm the English at Connor in Ulster, and Hugh O'Neill ambushes General Bagenal near Armagh. The book ends near Cork in 1601 when the English defeat O'Neill and his Spanish allies at Kinsale. Common people as well as kings appear in these pages. A foot soldier in the early days of gunpowder accidentally sets off a disastrous explosion, a harper's disembodied head is sent by error to the king of England, who displays it as that of the king of Ireland, and a Welsh camp follower named Alice is given the job of executing Irish captives during the English invasion. The sources for these stories and many more range from ancient manuscripts telling of mythical battles to a seventeenth-century siege diary. There are excerpts from such Irish literary masterpieces as The Cattle Raid of Cooley (The Tain), the monumental Annals of the Four Masters, passages from Gerald of Wales's account of the English conquest in the twelfth century, pages from an Icelandic saga, and even a blistering letter from Queen Elizabeth I to her inept commander in Ireland (""You do but piece up a hollow peace . . .

"Building a Better Race: Gender, Sexuality, and Eugenics from the Turn of the Century to the Baby Boom","""Building a Better Race powerfully demonstrates the centrality of eugenics during the first half of the twentieth century. Kline persuasively uncovers eugenics' unexpected centrality to modern assumptions about marriage, the family, and morality, even as late as the 1950s. The book is full of surprising connections and stories, and provides crucial new perspectives illuminating the history of eugenics, gender and normative twentieth-century sexuality.""—Gail Bederman, author of Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the US, 1880-1917 ""A strikingly fresh approach to eugenics.... Kline's work places eugenicists squarely at the center of modern reevaluations of females sexuality, sexual morality in general, changing gender roles, and modernizing family ideology.

Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution,"From one of the South′s foremost historians, this is the dramatic story of the conflict in South Carolina that was one of the most pivotal contributions to the American Revolution. In 1779, Britain strategised a war to finally subdue the rebellious American colonies with a minimum of additional time, effort, and blood. Setting sail from New York harbour with 8,500 ground troops, a powerful British fleet swung south towards South Carolina. One year later, Charleston fell. And as King George′s forces pushed inland and upward, it appeared the six-year-old colonial rebellion was doomed to defeat. In a stunning work on forgotten history, acclaimed historian Walter Edgar takes the American Revolution far beyond Lexington and Concord to re-create the pivotal months in a nation′s savage struggle for freedom. It is a story of military brilliance and devastating human blunders - and the courage of an impossibly outnumbered force of demoralised patriots who suffered terribly at the hands of a merciless enemy, yet slowly gained confidence through a series of small triumphs that convinced them their war could be won. Alive with incident and colour.",['Walter B.

Tenbow (Signet),"At the foot of the Wind River Mountains and just east of the continental divide was Tenbow Valley, eighty miles of rich, watered graze on the way to Oregon territory. From Cheyenne, Jack Stillman has come to Tenbow to solve a string of murders. Each victim was a landowner in the valley, and each killing was carried out with a deadly, long range rifle. Taking on the guise of a gambler, Stillman is quick to line up his suspects and start prying open their secrets. But while greed is the likeliest reason for the murders, the killer keeps striking—even when Stillman has his eye on the suspects. Suddenly, in a land of wild honeysuckle, snowy mountain peaks, and the spirits of native warriors, the veteran lawman realizes he's made a fatal mistake and missed a motive as old as time itself...Now it may be too late because an expert at murder has Stillman in the crosshairs of his gun...",['Matt Braun'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2InIH1I7QUcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=2InIH1I7QUcC&pg=PP5&dq=Tenbow+(Signet)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Paperbacks,2007-04-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2InIH1I7QUcC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/255_Tenbow__Signet_.jpg,Fiction,0

Raising the Hunley: The Remarkable History and Recovery of the Lost Confederate Submarine,"The history of the Confederate submarine H. L. Hunley is as astonishing as its disappearance. On February 17, 1864, after a legendary encounter with a Union battleship, the iron “fish boat” vanished without a trace somewhere off the coast of South Carolina. For more than a century the fate of the Hunley remained one of the great unsolved mysteries of the Civil War. Then, on August 8, 2000, with thousands of spectators crowding Charleston Harbor, the Hunley was raised from the bottom of the sea and towed ashore. Now, award-winning journalists Brian Hicks and Schuyler Kropf offer new insights into the Hunley’s final hours and recount the amazing true story of its rescue. The brainchild of wealthy New Orleans planter and lawyer Horace Lawson Hunley, the Hunley inspired tremendous hopes of breaking the Union’s naval blockade of Charleston, only to drown two crews on disastrous test runs. But on the night of February 17, 1864, the Hunley finally made good on its promise. Under the command of the heroic Lieutenant George E. Dixon, the sub rammed a spar torpedo into the Union sloop Housatonic and sank the ship within minutes, accomplishing a feat of stealth technology that would not be repeated for half a century. And then, shortly after its stunning success, the Hunley vanished. This book is an extraordinary true story peopled with a fascinating cast of characters, including Horace Hunley himself, the Union officers and crew who went down with the Housatonic, P. T. Barnum, who offered $100,000 for its recovery, and novelist Clive Cussler, who spearheaded the mission that finally succeeded in finding the Hunley. The drama of salvaging the sub is only the prelude to a page-turning account of how scientists unsealed this archaeological treasure chest and discovered the inner-workings of a submarine more technologically advanced than anyone expected, as well as numerous, priceless artifacts. Hicks and Kropf have crafted a spellbinding adventure story that spans over a century of American history. Dramatically told, filled with historical details and contemporary color, illustrated with breathtaking original photographs, Raising the Hunley is one of the most fascinating Civil War books to appear in years.","['Brian Hicks', 'Schuyler Kropf']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y1Bv8aoZ4qMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=y1Bv8aoZ4qMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Raising+the+Hunley:+The+Remarkable+History+and+Recovery+of+the+Lost+Confederate+Submarine&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Presidio Press,2007-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y1Bv8aoZ4qMC&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0,book_covers/682_Raising_the_Hunley__The_Remarkable_History_and_Recovery_of_the_Lost_Confederate_Submarine.jpg,History,1

Masks of Nyarlathotep: Adventures to Thwart the Dark God (Call of Cthulhu RPG),"Deel 1 van Alex Marshalls avontuurlijke fantasy-trilogie. Dit is epische fantasy zoals je die nog nooit hebt gelezen. Een Kroon voor Koud Zilver is deel 1 van Alex Marshalls avontuurlijke fantasy-trilogie, die doet denken aan een Tarantino-film. Dit is epische fantasy zoals je die nog nooit hebt gelezen. ‘Alles liep op rolletjes, tot aan het bloedbad...’ Twintig jaar geleden trok de gevreesde Kobalt Zosia met haar vijf trawanten en een huurlingenleger ten strijde en bracht ze het grootste koninkrijk ter wereld ten val. Toen er geen titels meer waren te winnen en geen werelden meer waren te veroveren, trok ze zich terug en liet ze haar legende verdwijnen in de geschiedenisboeken. Maar nu is het vreedzame bestaan dat ze voor zichzelf heeft opgebouwd ruw verstoord door de afslachting van haar complete dorp. Uit op wraak trekt Zosia weer ten strijde. Maar als ze gerechtigheid wil, zal ze eerst de confrontatie aan moeten gaan met een hoop wrok koesterende vijanden, oude bondgenoten met een twijfelachtige loyaliteit en een vreemd leger dat marcheert onder een wel heel vertrouwde banier. Vijf trawanten Een legendarische generaal En een laatste strijd om gerechtigheid ------------ ‘Een eersteklas fantasy-avontuur... schitterende verhaallijn, grimmige humor en een tandenknarsende intrige.’ Publishers Weekly (met ster) ‘Dit meeslepende avontuur schittert met details die de wereld tot leven brengen: echo’s van verloren culturen, drugsverslaafden die zich door giftige insecten laten prikken, en ongebruikelijke sekserollen.’ Library Journal (met ster) ‘Fans van diepzinnige verhaallijnen, ijzersterke heldinnen en fantasy-verhalen die je geheel in beslag nemen, zullen van dit boek gaan houden.’ RT Book Reviews ‘Rijk aan personages die worden gedreven door passie, plicht en angstaanjagend menselijke gebreken.

"The progressive historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington","Richard Hofstadter, the distinguished historian and twice winner of the Pulitzer Prize, brilliantly assesses the ideas and contributions of the three major American interpretive historians of the twentieth century: Frederick Jackson Turner, Charles A. Beard and V.L. Parrington. These men, whose views of history were shaped in large part by the political battles of the Progressive era, provided the Progressive movement with a usable past and the American liberal mind with a historical tradition. The Progressive Historians is at once a critique of historical thought during this decisive period of American development and an account of how these three writers led American historians into the controversial political world of the twentieth century. Turner, in developing his idea that American democracy is the outcome of the experience of frontier expansion and the settlement of the West, introduced his fellow historians to a set of new concepts and methods, and in doing so doing re-drew the guidelines of American historiography. Beard insisted upon the elitist origins of the Constitution, crusaded for the economic interpretation of history, and ultimately staked his historical reputation on an isolationist view of recent American foreign policy. Parrington emphasized the moral and social functions of literature, and read the history of literature as a history of the national political mind. In recent years, the tide has run against the Progressive historians, as one specialist after another has taken issue with their interpretations. The movement of contemporary historical thought has led to a rediscovery of the complexity of the American past. Although he cannot share the faith of the Progressive historians in the sufficiency of American liberalism as a guide to the modern world, Richard Hofstadter believes we have much to learn about ourselves from a reconsideration of their insights.",['Richard Hofstadter'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iLdMzbv2IDQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iLdMzbv2IDQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+progressive+historians:+Turner,+Beard,+Parrington&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Knopf,2012-02-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iLdMzbv2IDQC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/722_The_progressive_historians__Turner__Beard__Parrington.jpg,History,1

The (Magic) Kingdom Of God: Christianity And Global Culture Industries,"In The (Magic) Kingdom of God, Michael Budde offers a multidisciplinary analysis of the “global culture industries”—increasingly powerful, centralized corporate conglomerates in television, advertising, marketing, movies, and the like—and their impact on Christian churches in industrialized countries. Utilizing ideas from contemporary and classical schools of political economy, the author explains why the study of global culture industries is essential for understanding the current era of global capitalism.In suggesting that the cultural ecology shaped by these industries undermines many of the primary processes and structures through which people become committed Christians, Budde offers a novel utilization of linguistic-based theories of religious formation. Responses by churches to the new situation—more religious education or attempts to use the global culture industries for Christian purposes—are explored and found lacking. For the subversive praxis of Jesus of Nazareth to endure in the cultural ecology of postmodernism, Budde argues, churches must come to embrace their role as radical and countercultural alternative communities in which lay formation becomes a central preoccupation.",['Michael Budde'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gxlOswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=gxlOswEACAAJ&dq=The+(Magic)+Kingdom+Of+God:+Christianity+And+Global+Culture+Industries&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Westview Press,1998-09-11,http://books.google.com/books?id=gxlOswEACAAJ&dq=The+(Magic)+Kingdom+Of+God:+Christianity+And+Global+Culture+Industries&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/517_The__Magic__Kingdom_Of_God__Christianity_And_Global_Culture_Industries.jpg,Religion,2

The Crimean War (Modern Wars),"Winfried Baumgart's masterful history of the Crimean War has been expanded and fully updated to reflect advances made in the field since the book's first publication. It convincingly argues that if the war had continued after 1856, the First World War would have taken place 60 years earlier, but that fighting ultimately ceased because diplomacy never lost its control over the use of war as an instrument in power politics. With 19 images, 13 maps and additional tables as well as a brand new chapters on 'the medical services', this expanded and fully-updated 2nd edition explores * The origins and diplomacy of the Crimean War * The war aims and general attitudes of the belligerent powers (Russia, France, and Britain), non-belligerent German powers (Austria and Prussia) and a selected number of neutral powers, including the United States * The characteristics and capabilities of the armies involved * The nature of the fighting itself The Crimean War: 1853-1856 examines the conflict in both its Europe-wide and global contexts, moving beyond the five great European powers to consider the role and importance of smaller states and theatres of war that have otherwise been under-served. To this end, it looks at fighting on the Danube front, the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Caucasian battlefield, as well as the White Sea and the Pacific, with final chapters devoted to the Paris peace congress of 1856, the end of the war and its legacy. This book remains the definitive study of one of the most important wars in modern history.",['Winfried Baumgart'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wCW-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=wCW-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Crimean+War+(Modern+Wars)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2020-01-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wCW-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/860_The_Crimean_War__Modern_Wars_.jpg,History,1

God of the Fairy Tale: Finding Truth in the Land of Make-Believe,"What Treasures Are Hidden in the Enchanted Woods? More than just bedtime traditions, more than simple children’s literature, the most enduring stories are echoes of the greatest of all stories, the Gospel. God of the Fairy Tale is a collection of spiritual reflections on the truths found in classic fairy tales, truths that point us to the ultimate Truth about God, redemption, and ourselves. Delving into twenty classic folk and fairy tales, God of the Fairy Tale leads us into the mystical landscape of elves, goblins, and talking animals to reveal the jewels of truth that hide inside these most simple of stories. Through the fables of Snow White, Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, and many others, we discover a perspective not unlike that of the Bible–a world of people trying to be something more, questing to do good in a realm fraught with evil, where a turn of the tables leaves the strong defeated and the weak victorious. Each tale is presented along with a meditation on the spiritual and theological themes present. God of the Fairy Tale will warm your heart with a world of characters, creatures, and circumstances that spin an entertaining yarn and affirm the most essential Christian worldviews.",['Jim Ware'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=97TUTQ60M9kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=97TUTQ60M9kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=God+of+the+Fairy+Tale:+Finding+Truth+in+the+Land+of+Make-Believe&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,WaterBrook,2009-02-04,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=97TUTQ60M9kC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],1.0,book_covers/575_God_of_the_Fairy_Tale__Finding_Truth_in_the_Land_of_Make-Believe.jpg,Religion,2

Consolation in Philippians: Philosophical Sources and Rhetorical Strategy (Society for New Testament Studies Monograph Series),"Rhetorical criticism seeks to understand and comment on the way texts function in their social and cultural contexts. Holloway puts Paul's letter in the context of ancient theories and literary practices of 'consolation' and argues that Paul wrote to the Philippians in order to console them. Holloway shows that the letter has a unified overall strategy and provides a convincing account of Paul's argument. The book falls into two parts. Part I explores the integrity of Philippians, the rhetorical situation of the letter, and ancient consolation as the possible genre of Philippians, while Part II examines Phil. 1:3-11; 1:12-2:30; 3:1-4:1 and 4:2-23.

Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files,"When FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover reported to the Nixon White House in 1972 about the Bureau's surveillance of John Lennon, he began by explaining that Lennon was a ""former member of the Beatles singing group."" When a copy of this letter arrived in response to Jon Wiener's 1981 Freedom of Information request, the entire text was withheld—along with almost 200 other pages—on the grounds that releasing it would endanger national security. This book tells the story of the author's remarkable fourteen-year court battle to win release of the Lennon files under the Freedom of Information Act in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court. With the publication of Gimme Some Truth, 100 key pages of the Lennon FBI file are available—complete and unexpurgated, fully annotated and presented in a ""before and after"" format. Lennon's file was compiled in 1972, when the war in Vietnam was at its peak, when Nixon was facing reelection, and when the ""clever Beatle"" was living in New York and joining up with the New Left and the anti-war movement. The Nixon administration's efforts to ""neutralize"" Lennon are the subject of Lennon's file. The documents are reproduced in facsimile so that readers can see all the classification stamps, marginal notes, blacked out passages and—in some cases—the initials of J. Edgar Hoover. The file includes lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges. Fascinating, engrossing, at points hilarious and absurd, Gimme Some Truth documents an era when rock music seemed to have real political force and when youth culture challenged the status quo in Washington. It also delineates the ways the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations fought to preserve government secrecy, and highlights the legal strategies adopted by those who have challenged it.",['Jon Wiener'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FPPj3e_cQIcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FPPj3e_cQIcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Gimme+Some+Truth:+The+John+Lennon+FBI+Files&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Univ of California Press,2000-01-21,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FPPj3e_cQIcC&source=gbs_api,['History'],2.0,book_covers/684_Gimme_Some_Truth__The_John_Lennon_FBI_Files.jpg,History,1

"The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital: The Masons and the Building of Washington, D.C.","Today, there are more than twenty complete zodiacs in Washington, D.C., each one pointing to an extraordinary mystery. David Ovason, who has studied these astrological devices for ten years, now reveals why they have been placed in such abundance in the center of our nation's capital and explains their interconnections. His richly illustrated text tells the story of how Washington, from its foundation in 1791, was linked with the zodiac, with the meaning of certain stars, and with a hidden cosmological symbolism that he uncovers here for the first time. Fascinating and thoroughly researched, The Secret Architecture of Our Nation 's Capital is an engrossing book that raises provocative questions and otters complex insights into the meanings behind the mysterious symbols in Washington.",['David Ovason'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1Mg9oMrhVScC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1Mg9oMrhVScC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Secret+Architecture+of+Our+Nation%27s+Capital:+The+Masons+and+the+Building+of+Washington,+D.C.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harper Collins,2012-02-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1Mg9oMrhVScC&source=gbs_api,['History'],4.0,book_covers/823_The_Secret_Architecture_of_Our_Nation_s_Capital__The_Masons_and_the_Building_of_Washington__D_C_.jpg,History,1

Delaney's Desert Sheikh,"He’s game for a month of sun and fun, but this prince must never fall in love… Delaney Westmoreland is ready for some peace of mind after graduating from medical school. After eight years of nonstop studying, she’s more than earned a month at her cousin’s secluded, luxurious cabin. Unfortunately, it’s already occupied! The good news: the stranger is drop-dead gorgeous. The bad news: all he wants is to put her luggage back in the car so she can leave immediately. Not going to happen. Jamal Ari Yassir had just settled into his friend’s cabin when spitfire Delaney drove up. When he demands she leave, she simply picks up her luggage and moves into one of the spare bedrooms. Given how absolutely gorgeous she is, avoiding temptation will be sheer hell… and it’s not long before he gives in. But when their month together draws to a close, what’s a sheikh to do when his short-term fling has become so much more?

Seaplanes,"Beginning with races that were staged at elegant French resorts in the early part of the century, flying boats and seaplanes have played an integral part in aviation history. World War I spurred the development of these machines, and by the 1930s, flying boats and seaplanes had become pioneers in transcontinental flight. This photo-filled history recalls the role of flying boats and seaplanes in civil and military aviation history, and the enthusiasm of the engineers and pilots who are associated with their development. In addition to the golden years of hydraviation prior to World War II, author Nicolaou examines the decline of the seaplane, and its subsequent renaissance in nations that are today considered seaplane paradises.

Cape Breton Road: A Novel,"At nineteen, Innis Corbett is transplanted from his home near Boston and suddenly finds himself back in the remote Cape Breton community where he was born, the reluctant and unwelcome guest of his uncle Starr. Innis had developed an addiction for stealing expensive cars (not for money but for pleasure) and for the marijuana he helps his best friend to sell. When bad habits catch up with him, he is deported to Canada, a punishment worse than prison. Innis is unimpressed by his uncle, who gave up his dreams of leaving the island to repair televisions, chase women, drive a Lada and grow nostalgic on rum. Desperate to get away, Innis hatches the only escape plan he can, and starts to grow a secret cash crop of marijuana and looks for a car to steal. He bides his time smoking pot and doing whatever odd jobs he has to, full of unnamed need and pent-up anger. When Starr’s current girlfriend, an attractive woman in her late thirties, comes to stay while fleeing another relationship, Innis’ deep sense of longing fixes on her. He feels fierce desire, but also something he recognises as good and true. Starr cautions him, and a bitter jealous rivalry begins to rage between them, violence lying just under the surface. As summer arrives, Innis’ suffocation and the tension between the two men are palpable. Though life in this small community bound by memory and blood cannot cure Innis immediately of his anger, the rugged landscape does work a change on him. He takes on the challenge of the wild and harsh north woods where a man can get lost, learns the names of plants and wildlife, sketches and studies the natural world, and diligently cares for his illegal seedlings. As he grows stronger, he faces himself in the mirror and feels an emerging sense of self-worth and coming manhood. He realises he is learning an enjoyment of hard work and its rewards, although his crop might be less worthy than those of his predecessors. Affectionately sheltering the plants from bad weather and hungry deer, he muses, “Was there a Gaelic word for pot?” Cape Breton has spawned a wealth of contemporary literature, from Ann-Marie MacDonald’s Fall On Your Knees to Alistair MacLeod’s No Great Mischief and Lynn Coady’s Strange Heaven. The region’s rugged landscapes, rural life and distinctive Gaelic traditions converging with modern social pressures have captured the attention of readers internationally; as they have in the work of other Atlantic Canada authors such as Michael Crummey, Wayne Johnston and David Adams Richards. MacDonald set his novel in the 1970s, when a country area of Cape Breton could still be a truly isolated backwater, the phone service on a party-line system and listening-in a regular pastime. “I needed to create a world that was much more cut off, where it would seem like exile to Innis and where he could never be alone or anonymous.” Innis recalls his parents’ fights about “down home”, how they would one day love it to tears and the next day complain how it had held them back. Much as he wants to get off the Cape Breton Road, it may be that all the emotions that make life worth living — “love and anger and disappointment and hope” — lead back to the island. Cape Breton Road is a compelling coming-of-age story raw with beauty and emotion.",['D.R.

Even in the last decade of the twentieth century, when South-East Asia has become a major focus of foreign interest, Luang Prabang remains remote, pristine, and detached from the modern world, a city whose royal identity rests as much on myth and time-honoured ritual as recorded history.

Sherston's progress,"The third volume in Siegfried Sassoon’s beloved trilogy, The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston, with a new introduction by celebrated historian Paul Fussell A highly decorated English soldier and an acclaimed poet and novelist, Siegfried Sassoon won fame for his trilogy of fictionalized autobiographies that wonderfully capture the vanishing idylls of Edwardian England and the brutal realities of war. Having been deemed mentally ill for his anti-war sentiments and sent for treatment, George Sherston comes under the care of neurologist Dr. W. H. R. Rivers, who allows Sherston to sort through his attitudes toward the fighting (events that have also been semi-fictionalized by Pat Barker for her bestselling and critically acclaimed Regeneration Trilogy). After six months in the hospital, Sherston leaves to rejoin his regiment. He is soon dispatched to Ireland, where he attempts to reclaim some of the idyllic fox-hunting days of his youth, then to Palestine. He finally ends up at the Western Front in France, where he is shot in the head while on a reconnaissance mission and invalided back home. As the capstone of Sassoon's masterful Sherston trilogy, Sherston's Progress—whose evocation of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress is not at all accidental—literally brings home the unforgettable journey of George Sherston from aristocratic childhood through war hero and anti-war martyr, all the way to wounded veteran trying to move on from the Great War.

The Most Dangerous Man,"From Bill Minutaglio and Steven L. Davis, authors of the PEN Center USA award-winning Dallas 1963, comes a madcap narrative about Timothy Leary's daring prison escape and run from the law. On the moonlit evening of September 12, 1970, an ex-Harvard professor with a genius I.Q. studies a twelve-foot high fence topped with barbed wire. A few months earlier, Dr. Timothy Leary, the High Priest of LSD, had been running a gleeful campaign for California governor against Ronald Reagan. Now, Leary is six months into a ten-year prison sentence for the crime of possessing two marijuana cigarettes. Aided by the radical Weather Underground, Leary's escape from prison is the counterculture's union of ""dope and dynamite,"" aimed at sparking a revolution and overthrowing the government. Inside the Oval Office, President Richard Nixon drinks his way through sleepless nights as he expands the war in Vietnam and plots to unleash the United States government against his ever-expanding list of domestic enemies. Antiwar demonstrators are massing by the tens of thousands; homemade bombs are exploding everywhere; Black Panther leaders are threatening to burn down the White House; and all the while Nixon obsesses over tracking down Timothy Leary, whom he has branded ""the most dangerous man in America."" Based on freshly uncovered primary sources and new firsthand interviews, THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN AMERICA is an American thriller that takes readers along for the gonzo ride of a lifetime. Spanning twenty-eight months, President Nixon's careening, global manhunt for Dr. Timothy Leary winds its way among homegrown radicals, European aristocrats, a Black Panther outpost in Algeria, an international arms dealer, hash-smuggling hippies from the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, and secret agents on four continents, culminating in one of the trippiest journeys through the American counterculture.","['Bill Minutaglio', 'Steven L.

Never Done: A History of American Housework,"Finally back in print, with a new Preface by the author, this lively, authoritative, and pathbreaking study considers the history of material advances and domestic service, the ""women's separate sphere,"" and the respective influences of advertising, home economics, and women's entry into the workforce. Never Done begins by describing the household chores of nineteenth-century America: cooking at fireplaces and on cast-iron stoves, laundry done with boilers and flatirons, endless water-hauling and fire-tending, and so on. Strasser goes on to explain and explore how industrialization transformed the nature of women's work. Easing some tasks and eliminating others, new commercial processes inexorably altered women's daily lives and relationships—with each other and with those they served.",['Susan Strasser'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=32HAm8cczQ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=32HAm8cczQ4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Never+Done:+A+History+of+American+Housework&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Macmillan,2000-11,http://books.google.com/books?id=32HAm8cczQ4C&dq=Never+Done:+A+History+of+American+Housework&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/734_Never_Done__A_History_of_American_Housework.jpg,History,1
"Thank You, Comrade Stalin!: Soviet Public Culture from Revolution to Cold War","Thank you, our Stalin, for a happy childhood."" ""Thank you, dear Marshal [Stalin], for our freedom, for our children's happiness, for life."" Between the Russian Revolution and the Cold War, Soviet public culture was so dominated by the power of the state that slogans like these appeared routinely in newspapers, on posters, and in government proclamations. In this penetrating historical study, Jeffrey Brooks draws on years of research into the most influential and widely circulated Russian newspapers--including Pravda, Isvestiia, and the army paper Red Star--to explain the origins, the nature, and the effects of this unrelenting idealization of the state, the Communist Party, and the leader. Brooks shows how, beginning with Lenin, the Communists established a state monopoly of the media that absorbed literature, art, and science into a stylized and ritualistic public culture--a form of political performance that became its own reality and excluded other forms of public reflection. He presents and explains scores of self-congratulatory newspaper articles, including tales of Stalin's supposed achievements and virtue, accounts of the country's allegedly dynamic economy, and warnings about the decadence and cruelty of the capitalist West. Brooks pays particular attention to the role of the press in the reconstruction of the Soviet cultural system to meet the Nazi threat during World War II and in the transformation of national identity from its early revolutionary internationalism to the ideology of the Cold War. He concludes that the country's one-sided public discourse and the pervasive idea that citizens owed the leader gratitude for the ""gifts"" of goods and services led ultimately to the inability of late Soviet Communism to diagnose its own ills, prepare alternative policies, and adjust to new realities. The first historical work to explore the close relationship between language and the implementation of the Stalinist-Leninist program, Thank You, Comrade Stalin! is a compelling account of Soviet public culture as reflected through the country's press.",['Jeffrey Brooks'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YugSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YugSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thank+You,+Comrade+Stalin!:+Soviet+Public+Culture+from+Revolution+to+Cold+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Princeton University Press,2021-04-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YugSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/747_Thank_You__Comrade_Stalin___Soviet_Public_Culture_from_Revolution_to_Cold_War.jpg,History,1

Fanny Hill,"Fanny Hill, shrouded in controversy for most of its more than 250-year life, and banned from publication in the United States until 1966, was once considered immoral and without literary merit, even earning its author a jail sentence for obscenity. The tale of a naïve young prostitute in bawdy eighteenth-century London who slowly rises to respectability, the novel–and its popularity–endured many bannings and critics, and today Fanny Hill is considered an important piece of political parody and sexual philosophy on par with French libertine novels.

The Lucifer Wars,"Something Has Gone Terribly Wrong in Our World Two thousand years after the cross, evil continues to brutalize and pillage in every nation and no one appears able to do very much about it. Why has the church made so little progress? While Satan lost his authority to rule on the earth, he did not lose his power. Failure to recognize this crucial difference has caused us to miss the point as to what the war over the planet is about and therefore, what we must do to win it. Lucifer’s War offers a detailed, historical examination of Satan, the demon gods who are aligned with him, and their ancient struggle with God over humanity. While the church is the only agency on earth authorized by Jesus to deal with evil at its root cause, believers must acknowledge what has not worked and pursue a different strategy that will. This book will change the way you pray, equip you to understand the times we are living in, and prepare you for what may happen next and what you can do about it.",['Linda Rios Brook'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3GW7s-BM0u8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=3GW7s-BM0u8C&pg=PA146&dq=The+Lucifer+Wars&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Charisma Media,2012-10-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3GW7s-BM0u8C&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],1.0,book_covers/621_The_Lucifer_Wars.jpg,Religion,2
Hunter-Killer: U.S. Escort Carriers in the Battle of the Atlantic,"The pursuit of German U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic has long been considered one of the most exciting stories of World War II. This definitive study takes readers into the cockpits and onto the flight decks of the versatile and hardy U.S. escort carriers (CVEs) to tell of their vital, yet little-known contribution to the anti-U-boat campaign. Sailing apart from the Allied convoys, the CVE captains had complete freedom of action and frequently took their ships on ""hunt and kill"" missions against the enemy. The German submarines were allowed no respite and no place to relax without the fear of discovery. World War II historian William Y'Blood explains that in the eighteen months between the spring of 1943, when the escort carriers began to prowl the Atlantic, to November 1944, the average number of U-boats in daily operation was reduced from 108 to a mere 31. Though land-based aircraft, various support groups, and the convoy system itself helped win the Battle of the Atlantic, the escort carrier groups' influence was profound. In addition to documenting the escort carriers' exciting operational history, the author also traces the CVE's development and construction and examines its tactical and strategic uses.","[""William T.

Suspects,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A dedicated CIA agent becomes an unexpected ally to a woman haunted by the kidnapping of her family, in this thrilling novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Danielle Steel. Theodora Morgan is fashion royalty. Founder of a wildly popular online shopping service, she is one of the most successful businesswomen in the world, although she prefers to keep a low profile, especially over the last months. It was a year ago when the unthinkable struck her family, and her husband, industry mogul Matthieu Pasquier, and their son were kidnapped and held for ransom—a nightmare that ended in tragedy. The case has gone cold, despite evidence linking the crime to Matthieu’s Russian competitors. Theo has reluctantly gone back to work running her company. On the flight to a launch party for one of her highly anticipated pop-up shops in New York City, she crosses paths with high-society networker Pierre de Vaumont. Theo politely invites him to her event—unaware that Pierre has been flagged by the CIA. Senior supervising CIA operative Mike Andrews investigates Pierre’s suspicious Russian contacts and clears him to enter the country, but when he realizes that Theodora Morgan is on the same flight, he becomes concerned for her safety. Posing as a lawyer, Mike begins a covert mission—starting with Theo’s opening party. When Mike and Theo meet, their connection is instant, but Theo is completely unaware of Mike’s true objective or identity… or that the life she is rebuilding is in grave danger.",['Danielle Steel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IuRGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IuRGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Suspects&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Delacorte Press,2022-06-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IuRGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0,book_covers/307_Suspects.jpg,Fiction,0
"King, Priest, and Prophet: A Trinitarian Theology of Atonement (Theology for the 21st Century)","The doctrines of the atonement and the Trinity are central not only to the Christian faith but also to Christian systematic theology. Over the last decade or so, one or another theological interpretation of either of these doctrines has assumed pride of place among theologians. Before Robert Sherman, though, no theologian has ever dared to read the atonement in light of the Trinity. Most of the time atonement theories simply focus on the redeeming work of Jesus Christ, without any reference to Christ's relationship to the Father and the Spirit of the Trinity. But, as Sherman argues, Christ's atoning work is diverse and cannot be limited to one who ransoms our sins or to one who has victory over our sins (although in Sherman's view Christ's atoning work includes these tasks and more). He offers here a constructive theological proposal that connects Trinity with the rubrics of prophet, priest, and king to help explain Christ's atoning work. One can understand adequately neither Christ's multifaceted reconciliation of a complex humanity to God nor that reconciliations fundamental unity as God's gracious act apart form the Trinity. Without this framework, one will likely stress one person of the Trinity, one aspect of God's reconciling work, and/or one understanding of the human predicament to the exclusion of others and the detriment of theology, both systematic and pastoral. Sherman's constructive theological proposal suggests that we should recognize a certain correspondence and mutual support between the three persons of the Trinity, the three offices of Christ (king, prophet, priest), and the three commonly recognized models of his atoning work (Christus victor, vicarious sacrifice, moral exemplar). Sherman's book offers a well-nuanced and well-grounded constructive theology of Trinitarian atonement and is a significant addition to the Theology for the Twenty-First Century Series. Robert J. Sherman is Professor of Christian Theology at Bangor Theological Seminary in Maine. His work has appeared in such publications as the Scottish Journal of Theology, the International Journal of Systematic Theology, and The Journal of Religion.",['Robert J.

All of the Women of the Bible,"All the women of the Bible offers a rich biographical perspective on evey female figure in scripture -- including the famous, the little-known, and even the unnamed. In more that 300 engaging and insightful portraits, Edith Deen brings alive the saints and sorceresses, queens and servants, mothers and daughters, wives and widows whose profound influence is felt through-out the Bible. ""You can almost trace light and darkness in the Bible by the women themselves,""she writes. ""Hannah, praying mother of Samuel, gave birth to a son who became the first great Hebrew prophet. And, of course, there was the mother of Jesus. On the other hand, Jezebel and Herodias were vile influences, the first tearing apart the northern kingdom of Israel, the second causing John the Baptist to be beheaded."" Combining thorough detail with a lively and dramatic narrative, All of the Women of the Bible portrays the real women behind the Biblical stories and shows how, in their human struggles and triumphs, they are very much like the women of today. With each major biography identified by Bible chapter and verse and prefaced by a key passage of scripture, this is an ideal resources for teachers, Bible students, preachers, and writers, as well as anyone who wants to learn what it was really like to be a woman in Biblical times.",['Edith Deen'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9zVDeI50QHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9zVDeI50QHIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=All+of+the+Women+of+the+Bible&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,1988-08-03,http://books.google.com/books?id=9zVDeI50QHIC&dq=All+of+the+Women+of+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],8.0,book_covers/419_All_of_the_Women_of_the_Bible.jpg,Religion,2
THE TRINITY,"Paul s ways of speaking about God, Jesus, and the Spirit are intricately intertwined: talking about any one of the three, for Paul, implies reference to all of them together. However, much current Pauline scholarship discusses Paul s God-, Christ-, and Spirit-language without reference to trinitarian theology. In contrast to that trend, Wesley Hill argues in this book that later, post-Pauline trinitarian theologies represent a better approach, opening a fresh angle on Paul s earlier talk about God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Spirit. Hill looks critically at certain well-known discussions in the field of New Testament studies -- those by N. T. Wright, Richard Bauckham, Larry Hurtado, and others -- in light of patristic and contemporary trinitarian theologies, resulting in an innovative approach to an old set of questions. Adeptly integrating biblical exegesis and historical-systematic theology, Hill s Paul and the Trinity shows how trinitarian theologies illumine interpretive difficulties in a way that more recent theological concepts have failed to do.",['Wesley Hill'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xastBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xastBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=THE+TRINITY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wm.

Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat (Combat Aircraft),"So formidable an opponent did the Iraqi airforce consider the F-14 that during the Iran-Iraq war, they ordered their pilots not to engage F-14s and the presence of one in an area was usually enough to empty it of Iraqi aircraft. Officially losses where tiny; only one F-14 was lost in aerial combat (to a MiG-21), one to a control problem and one downed by a ground-to-air missile. This book looks at the F-14's Iranian combat history and includes first hand accounts from the pilots themselves. It will consider key engagements and the central figures involved, illustrating the realities, successes and failures of the Iranian air campaign.","['Tom Cooper', 'Farzad Bishop']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J5seDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=J5seDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Iranian+F-14+Tomcat+Units+in+Combat+(Combat+Aircraft)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2012-11-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J5seDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/892_Iranian_F-14_Tomcat_Units_in_Combat__Combat_Aircraft_.jpg,History,1

STUDIES IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT,"This is an exposition of Jesus' keynote sermon by one of the foremost preachers of the twentieth century. The essence of 60 consecutive sermons given over the course of more than a year at Westminster Chapel, London, is preserved in this contemporary devotional classic. The Sermon on the Mount is one of the most familiar passages in the Bible, but is also one of the most frequently misunderstood. For Martyn Lloyd-Jones, the failure of the church today to appropriate its message is a telling symptom of its superficiality, ineffectiveness and unattractiveness. 'The Doctor', as he was affectionately known, shows the remedy for the church's lamentable weakness in Jesus' lakeside teaching, which he explains and applies memorably, through the Sermon's rainbow of themes - including blessedness, joy, spiritual mourning, salt and light, denying oneself, fasting, anxiety, discernment, self-deception, and the trials and tests of faith.

Gentlemen's Blood: A History of Dueling,"""Never, never, did I imagine that dueling could be so enthralling, outrageous, gruesome, tragic, and, yes, ridiculous...Lively humor and sparkling prose."" -Wall Street Journal The medieval justice of trial by combat evolved into the private duel by sword and pistol, with thousands of honorable men-and not-so-honorable women-giving lives and limbs to wipe out an insult or prove a point. The duel was essential to private, public, and political life, and those who followed the elaborate codes of procedure were seldom prosecuted and rarely convicted-for, in fact, they were obeying a grand old tradition.

Deus ex Machina,"On a distant island, reality show contestants battle for bragging rights and a slot on next week's episode. They've perfected their dramatic roles and are prepared to do whatever it takes to win. There's the take–no–prisoners Marine sergeant, the gay hairdresser, the ruthless lawyer, the brainy poet. But one player refuses to compete—Gloria Hamm, a sullen dental hygienist, voted least likely to win by the show's crew. The higher–ups are desperate for ratings and sensational twists to trump the plots of seasons past. But the producer—haunted by personal tragedies all too real—is losing control of the show and its crew. While he obsesses about Gloria, the crew plots mutiny, a contestant dances with insanity, and disease threatens to halt the show completely. When real catastrophes strike, the producer finds it harder and harder to navigate his surreal landscape, where boundaries of the real, imagined, and orchestrated have blurred beyond recognition. Deus Ex Machina deconstructs our notions of narrative, revealing how tricky it is for any auteur to disappear from his creation. In an age when people will seemingly do anything to be on television, it asks what is the true nature of ""reality,"" and what is its cost?",['Andrew Foster Altschul'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TtoREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=TtoREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Deus+ex+Machina&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Catapult,2011-02-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TtoREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0,book_covers/87_Deus_ex_Machina.jpg,Fiction,0

Dune (Spanish Edition),"En el desértico planeta Arrakis, el agua es el bien más preciado y llorar a los muertos, el símbolo de máxima prodigalidad. Pero algo hace de Arrakis una pieza estratégica para los intereses del emperador, las Grandes Casas y la Cofradía, los tres grandes poderes de la galaxia. Arrakis es el único origen conocido de la melange, preciosa especia y uno de los bienes más codiciados del universo. Al duque Leto Atreides se le asigna el gobierno de este mundo inhóspito, habitado por los indómitos Fremen y por monstruosos gusanos de arena de centenares de metros de longitud. Sin embargo, cuando la familia es traicionada, su hijo y heredero, Paul, emprenderá un viaje hacia un destino más grande del que jamás hubiese podido soñar. Mezcla fascinante de aventura, misticismo, intrigas políticas y ecologismo, Dune se convirtió, desde el momento de su publicación, en un fenómeno de culto y en la mayor epopeya de ciencia ficción de todos los tiempos. «No conozco nada comparable, excepto El Señor de los Anillos.» -Arthur C. Clarke ENGLISH DESCRIPTION Frank Herbert's classic masterpiece--a triumph of the imagination and one of the bestselling science fiction novels of all time. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the ""spice"" melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for.... When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul's family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream. A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.",['Herbert Frank'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AKOVzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=AKOVzQEACAAJ&dq=Dune+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Salamandra Bolsillo,2020-11-17,http://books.google.com/books?id=AKOVzQEACAAJ&dq=Dune+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/103_Dune__Spanish_Edition_.jpg,Fiction,0

In a mild December in the year of our Lord 1141, a new priest comes to the parishioners of the Foregate outside the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Father Ailnoth brings with him a housekeeper and her nephew—and a disposition that invites murder. Brother Cadfael quickly sees that father Ailnoth is a harsh man who, striding along in his black cassock, looks like a doomsaying raven. The housekeeper’s nephew, Benet, is quite different—a smiling lad, a hard worker in Cadfael’s herb garden, but, as Brother Cadfael soon discovers, an impostor. And when Ailnoth is found drowned, suspicion falls on Benet, though many in the Foregate had cause to want this priest dead.

The death and life of Bishop Pike,"Introducing two Stringfellow/Towne reprints about Bishop Pike: The Bishop Pike Affair The Death and Life of Bishop Pike The Death and Life of Bishop Pike is an in-depth, documented portrait of James A. Pike--the most controversial American clergyman of modern times. Based on prodigious research into private letters and unpublished documents, as well as exhaustive interviews, it is a biography so candid that the book itself is bound to be controversial. The authors are utterly frank about the bishop's turbulent personal life--his three marriages, his sexuality, his alcoholism, the suicides of his oldest son and of an intimate associate, the temptation of his celebrity, his complex relationship with his mother, and his terrible death in the wilderness. They have thoroughly investigated his notorious experiences with ""psychic phenomena""--arriving at their own startling and provocative conclusions. Nevertheless, this book is neither an expose nor an apologia. It is an honest, dramatic, and compelling testament to an extraordinary and vital personality--to the colorful and courageous Christian witness of Bishop James A. Pike, whose advocacy of social justice and whose search for faith--restless and unorthodox as it was--had an astonishing impact on the contemporary church.","['William Stringfellow', 'Anthony Towne']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gT37DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=gT37DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+death+and+life+of+Bishop+Pike&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2007-06-05,http://books.google.com/books?id=gT37DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+death+and+life+of+Bishop+Pike&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/455_The_death_and_life_of_Bishop_Pike.jpg,Religion,2

"Kinkeeper (New Women's Voices Series, No. 18)","A history of independent African American settlements in Texas during the Jim Crow era, featuring historical and contemporary photographs. In the decades following the Civil War, nearly a quarter of African Americans achieved a remarkable victory—they got their own land. While other ex-slaves and many poor whites became trapped in the exploitative sharecropping system, these independence-seeking individuals settled on pockets of unclaimed land that had been deemed too poor for farming and turned them into successful family farms. In these self-sufficient rural communities, often known as “freedom colonies,” African Americans created a refuge from the discrimination and violence that routinely limited the opportunities of blacks in the Jim Crow South. Freedom Colonies is the first book to tell the story of these independent African American settlements. Thad Sitton and James Conrad focus on communities in Texas, where blacks achieved a higher percentage of land ownership than in any other state of the Deep South. The authors draw on a vast reservoir of ex-slave narratives, oral histories, written memoirs, and public records to describe how the freedom colonies formed and to recreate the lifeways of African Americans who made their living by farming or in skilled trades such as milling and blacksmithing. They also uncover the forces that led to the decline of the communities from the 1930s onward, including economic hard times and the greed of whites who found legal and illegal means of taking black-owned land. And they visit some of the remaining communities to discover how their independent way of life endures into the twenty-first century. “Thad Sitton and James H. Conrad have made an important contribution to African American and southern history with their study of communities fashioned by freedmen in the years after emancipation.” —Journal of American History “This study is a thoughtful and important addition to an understanding of rural Texas and the nature of black settlements.” —Journal of Southern History","['Thad Sitton', 'James H.

The ruse was to last just one night, but the following morning Elyn was nowhere to be found!

Partisans,"From one of the South′s foremost historians, this is the dramatic story of the conflict in South Carolina that was one of the most pivotal contributions to the American Revolution. In 1779, Britain strategised a war to finally subdue the rebellious American colonies with a minimum of additional time, effort, and blood. Setting sail from New York harbour with 8,500 ground troops, a powerful British fleet swung south towards South Carolina. One year later, Charleston fell. And as King George′s forces pushed inland and upward, it appeared the six-year-old colonial rebellion was doomed to defeat. In a stunning work on forgotten history, acclaimed historian Walter Edgar takes the American Revolution far beyond Lexington and Concord to re-create the pivotal months in a nation′s savage struggle for freedom. It is a story of military brilliance and devastating human blunders - and the courage of an impossibly outnumbered force of demoralised patriots who suffered terribly at the hands of a merciless enemy, yet slowly gained confidence through a series of small triumphs that convinced them their war could be won.

Studies in Isaiah,"The Knowing the Bible series is a new resource designed to help Bible readers better understand and apply God’s Word. Each 12-week study leads participants through one book of the Bible and is made up of four basic components: (1) Reflection questions designed to help readers engage the text at a deeper level; (2) “Gospel Glimpses” highlighting the gospel of grace throughout the book; (3) “Whole-Bible Connections” showing how any given passage connects to the Bible’s overarching story of redemption culminating in Christ; and (4) “Theological Soundings” identifying how historic orthodox doctrines are taught or reinforced throughout Scripture. With contributions from a wide array of influential pastors and church leaders, these gospel-centered studies will help Christians see and cherish the message of God’s grace on each and every page of the Bible. Pastor Drew Hunter helps readers understand and apply the challenging words of the prophet Isaiah in this 12-week study. Isaiah’s prophecy, which alternates between promises of judgment and restoration, reminds God’s people of the magnitude of humanity’s sin, the judgment that we all deserve, and how God displays his glory by saving sinners. Throughout the study, Hunter continually shows how Isaiah’s promise of cosmic renewal ultimately anticipates the work of Jesus Christ, the servant-king whose death would result in new life for all who trust in him.",['Drew Hunter'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4EdfZe2A9lgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=4EdfZe2A9lgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Studies+in+Isaiah&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crossway,2013-04-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4EdfZe2A9lgC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/478_Studies_in_Isaiah.jpg,Religion,2

"The Devil in Silicon Valley: Northern California, Race, and Mexican Americans","This sweeping history explores the growing Latino presence in the United States over the past two hundred years. It also debunks common myths about Silicon Valley, one of the world's most influential but least-understood places. Far more than any label of the moment, the devil of racism has long been Silicon Valley's defining force, and Stephen Pitti argues that ethnic Mexicans--rather than computer programmers--should take center stage in any contemporary discussion of the ""new West."" Pitti weaves together the experiences of disparate residents--early Spanish-Mexican settlers, Gold Rush miners, farmworkers transplanted from Texas, Chicano movement activists, and late-twentieth-century musicians--to offer a broad reevaluation of the American West. Based on dozens of oral histories as well as unprecedented archival research, The Devil in Silicon Valley shows how San José, Santa Clara, and other northern California locales played a critical role in the ongoing development of Latino politics. This is a transnational history. In addition to considering the past efforts of immigrant and U.S.-born miners, fruit cannery workers, and janitors at high-tech firms--many of whom retained strong ties to Mexico--Pitti describes the work of such well-known Valley residents as César Chavez. He also chronicles the violent opposition ethnic Mexicans have faced in Santa Clara Valley. In the process, he reinterprets not only California history but the Latino political tradition and the story of American labor. This book follows California race relations from the Franciscan missions to the Gold Rush, from the New Almaden mine standoff to the Apple janitorial strike. As the first sustained account of Northern California's Mexican American history, it challenges conventional thinking and tells a fascinating story. Bringing the past to bear on the present, The Devil in Silicon Valley is counter-history at its best.",['Stephen J.

Father Goriot,"Old Goriot or Father Goriot is an 1835 novel by French novelist and playwright Honore de Balzac (1799–1850), included in the Scenes de la vie Parisienne section of his novel sequence La Comedie humaine. Set in Paris in 1819, it follows the intertwined lives of three characters: the elderly doting Goriot; a mysterious criminal-in-hiding named Vautrin; and a naive law student named Eugene de Rastignac.Originally published in serial form during the winter of 1834/35, Le Pere Goriot is widely considered Balzac's most important novel. It marks the first serious use by the author of characters who had appeared in other books, a technique that distinguishes Balzac's fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style, using minute details to create character and subtext.The novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought profound changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters – especially young Rastignac, who grew up in the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.The novel was released to mixed reviews. Some critics praised the author for his complex characters and attention to detail; others condemned him for his many depictions of corruption and greed. A favorite of Balzac's, the book quickly won widespread popularity and has often been adapted for film and the stage. It gave rise to the French expression ""Rastignac"", a social climber willing to use any means to better his situation.",['Honoré de Balzac'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T3lTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=T3lTEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Father+Goriot&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,BEYOND BOOKS HUB,2021-01-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T3lTEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/81_Father_Goriot.jpg,Fiction,0

A Seahorse Year: A Novel,"A San Francisco family copes with a teenage son’s mental illness in “a wonderful book, with characters that bounce off the page” (Elizabeth Strout). Named a Best Book of the Year by Newsday and the San Francisco Chronicle In this “profound, heart-wrenching, and resonant” Lambda Award–winning novel, a quintessentially modern family is transformed by the mental breakdown of their adolescent son (Francisco Goldman). When Christopher disappears from his San Francisco home, his extended family comes together in a frantic search. But the sixteen-year-old is in much more trouble than they know, and their attempts to both support and save him will challenge their assumptions about themselves and one another.

Collapse at Meuse-Argonne: The Failure of the Missouri-Kansas Division,"During World War I, the Thirty-fifth Division was made up of National Guard units from Missouri and Kansas. Composed of thousands of men from the two states, the Missouri-Kansas Division entered the great battle of the Meuse-Argonne with no battle experience and only a small amount of training, a few weeks of garrisoning in a quiet sector in Alsace. The division fell apart in five days, and the question Robert Ferrell attempts to answer is why. The Thirty-fifth Division was based at Camp Doniphan on the Fort Sill reservation in Oklahoma and was trained essentially for stationary, or trench, warfare. In March 1918, the German army launched a series of offensives that nearly turned the tide on the Western Front. The tactics were those of open warfare, quick penetrations by massive forces, backed by heavy artillery and machine guns. The American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) commanded by Gen. John J. Pershing were unprepared for this change in tactics. When the Thirty-fifth Division was placed in the opening attack in the Meuse-Argonne on September 26, 1918, it quickly fell. In addition to the Thirty-fifth Division’s lack of experience, its problems were compounded by the necessary confusions of turning National Guard units into a modern assemblage of men and machines. Although the U.S. Army utilized observers during the initial years of World War I, their dispatches had piled up in the War College offices in Washington and, unfortunately, were never studied. The Thirty-fifth Division was also under the command of an incompetent major general and an incompetent artillery brigadier. The result was a debacle in five days, with the division line pushed backward and held only by the 110th Engineer Regiment of twelve hundred men, bolstered by what retreating men could be shoved into the line, some of them at gunpoint. Although three divisions got into trouble at the outset of the Meuse-Argonne, the Thirty-fifth’s failure was the worst. After the collapse, the Red Cross representative of the division, Henry J. Allen, became governor of Kansas and instigated investigations by both houses of Congress. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker testified in an effort to limit the political damage. But the hullabaloo gradually died down, and the whole sad episode passed into the darker corridors of history. By focusing on a single event in history, Collapse at Meuse-Argonne offers a unique glimpse into one of the most critical battles of World War I. Historians, as well as the general reader, will find this new perspective on what really happened to the Thirty-fifth Division fascinating.",['Robert H.

Mortal Remains in Maggody,"Another “great” cozy mystery set in outrageous Maggody, Arkansas, a town so strange that even Hollywood filmmakers can’t believe it’s real (Library Journal). From the Kwik-Stoppe-Shoppe to the Pot O’ Gold Mobile Home Park, there isn’t much glamour in Maggody . . . but this flyspeck Arkansas town is about to become famous. When a Hollywood production company chooses Maggody as a backdrop for an X-rated Ozarks “Romeo and Juliet,” the locals are starstruck. And as Maggody is flooded with washed-up actors, ruthless producers, and a cynical crew, the townsfolk will do anything for a close-up—even if it means resorting to murder. Chief of Police Arly Hanks has no time for Hollywood—she’s got her hands full with a local arsonist—but when one of the actors is found dead in a bathtub, she’s forced to intervene. As the film spins out of control, Arly realizes that the citizens of Maggody will stop at nothing to get their fifteen minutes of fame—even as the town burns down around them. In the spirit of David Mamet’s State and Main, this delightful novel shows that when Hollywood collides with small-town values, the movie industry doesn’t stand a chance. Mortal Remains in Maggody is the 5th book in the Arly Hanks Mysteries, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.",['Joan Hess'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3D8EDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3D8EDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mortal+Remains+in+Maggody&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2016-06-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3D8EDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/192_Mortal_Remains_in_Maggody.jpg,Fiction,0

Queer Cowboys: And Other Erotic Male Friendships in Nineteenth-Century American Literature,"Why do the earliest representations of cowboy-figures symbolizing the highest ideals of manhood in American culture exclude male-female desire while promoting homosocial and homoerotic bonds? Evidence from the best-known Western writers and artists of the post-Civil War period - Owen Wister, Mark Twain, Frederic Remington, George Catlin - as well as now-forgotten writers, illustrators, and photographers, suggest that in the period before the word 'homosexual' and its synonyms were invented, same-sex intimacy and erotic admiration were key aspects of a masculine code. These males-only clubs of journalists, cowboys, miners, Indian vaqueros defined themselves by excluding femininity and the cloying ills of domesticity, while embracing what Roosevelt called 'strenuous living' with other bachelors in the relative 'purity' of wilderness conditions. Queer Cowboys recovers this forgotten culture of exclusively masculine, sometimes erotic, and often intimate camaraderie in fiction, photographs, illustrations, song lyrics, historical ephemera, and theatrical performances.",['C.

Soul of Viktor Tronko,"When Soviet agent Viktor Tronko defected to the US in 1964, he made two intriguing claims: he insisted that Russia had not placed a mole inside the CIA, and that Lee Harvey Oswald had not been recruited to assassinate the president. Convinced that Tronko was working as a disinformation agent, the CIA furiously did everything they could to break him. But Tronko had one more surprise for them: he refused to break. Almost two decades later, former CIA officer Mel Pokorny shows up at journalist Michael Kessler's house and offers to talk about Tronko. It's the scoop of a lifetime for Kessler. But the more he investigates, the closer he gets to the truth: a truth so shocking that someone would do anything to keep it under wraps. This could be the biggest story of his life...if it doesn't kill him first.

"The Everything Jesus Book: His Life, His Teachings (Everything (Religion))","Discover how participating in religion or having information about Jesus is not the same as knowing Jesus personally. There is significant difference between pursuing a personal encounter with Jesus and pursuing information about Jesus. Information alone can become heavy religious baggage. Information does not love, forgive, comfort, save, or heal . . . Jesus does! Many people desire a closer relationship with Jesus of Nazareth and are seeking a deeper understanding of his teaching and how they might apply to their daily life. Would it surprise you to know that Jesus has the same desire? He wants to know you, love you, and be part of your daily life. The teachings of Jesus reveal the heart of Jesus as nothing else does. “An intriguing and inspiring book that offers invaluable lessons about living an abundant life, drawn from the fascinating experiences of the author and the captivating stories about people from all walks of life who were blessed by spiritual enlightenment.” —Edwin Meese III, former US Attorney General, Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow Emeritus at Heritage Foundation “An amazing book that captures the essential teachings of Jesus and how to apply them as a modern-day disciple.

Opus Dei: An Investigation into the Powerful Secretive Society within the Catholic Church,"An Inside Look at the Secretive Catholic Organization Made Famous by The Da Vinci Code Is Opus Dei a spiritual institute dedicated to preserving Catholic orthodoxy in the face of modernist assault? Or is it an independent society, a ""church within the Church,"" promoting its own allegiances and preserving an antiquated set of spiritual and penitential practices? This small organization wields enormous power within the Catholic Church. Due to its status as a ""personal prelature"" of the pope, it operates independently of local Church authority. The influence of Opus Dei has only grown since this book first appeared. Opus Dei's founder, St. Josemaría Escrivá, was beatified and canonized over the vehement objections of many in the Catholic Church.

Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper,"An in-depth look at how The New York Times failed in its coverage of the fate of European Jews from 1939-45. It examines how the decisions that were made at The Times ultimately resulted in the minimizing and misunderstanding of modern history's worst genocide. Laurel Leff, a veteran journalist and professor of journalism, recounts how personal relationships at the newspaper, the assimilationist tendencies of The Times' Jewish owner, and the ethos of mid-century America, all led The Times to consistently downplay news of the Holocaust. It recalls how news of Hitler's 'final solution' was hidden from readers and - because of the newspaper's influence on other media - from America at large.

The Story of Texas,"A New York Times bestseller! “Lively and absorbing. . ."" — The New York Times Book Review ""Engrossing."" —Wall Street Journal “Entertaining and well-researched . . . ” —Houston Chronicle Three noted Texan writers combine forces to tell the real story of the Alamo, dispelling the myths, exploring why they had their day for so long, and explaining why the ugly fight about its meaning is now coming to a head. Every nation needs its creation myth, and since Texas was a nation before it was a state, it's no surprise that its myths bite deep. There's no piece of history more important to Texans than the Battle of the Alamo, when Davy Crockett and a band of rebels went down in a blaze of glory fighting for independence from Mexico, losing the battle but setting Texas up to win the war. However, that version of events, as Forget the Alamo definitively shows, owes more to fantasy than reality. Just as the site of the Alamo was left in ruins for decades, its story was forgotten and twisted over time, with the contributions of Tejanos--Texans of Mexican origin, who fought alongside the Anglo rebels--scrubbed from the record, and the origin of the conflict over Mexico's push to abolish slavery papered over. Forget the Alamo provocatively explains the true story of the battle against the backdrop of Texas's struggle for independence, then shows how the sausage of myth got made in the Jim Crow South of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. As uncomfortable as it may be to hear for some, celebrating the Alamo has long had an echo of celebrating whiteness. In the past forty-some years, waves of revisionists have come at this topic, and at times have made real progress toward a more nuanced and inclusive story that doesn't alienate anyone. But we are not living in one of those times; the fight over the Alamo's meaning has become more pitched than ever in the past few years, even violent, as Texas's future begins to look more and more different from its past. It's the perfect time for a wise and generous-spirited book that shines the bright light of the truth into a place that's gotten awfully dark.","['Bryan Burrough', 'Chris Tomlinson', 'Jason Stanford']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nLZPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nLZPEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=The+Story+of+Texas&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2022-06-07,http://books.google.com/books?id=nLZPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Story+of+Texas&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],3.0,book_covers/958_The_Story_of_Texas.jpg,History,1
Beyond Eurocentrism: A New View of Modern World History,"Eurocentrism influences virtually all established historical writing. With the rise of Prussia and, by extension, Europe, eurocentrism became the dominant paradigm for world history. Employing the approaches of Gramsci and Foucault, Peter Gran proposes a reconceptualization of world history. He challenges the traditional convention of relying on totalitarian or democratic functions of a particular state to explain and understand relationships of authority and resistance in a number of national contexts. Gran maintains that there is no single developmental model but diverse forms of hegemony that emerged out of the political crisis following the penetration of capitalism into each nation. In making comparisons between seemingly disparate and distinctive nations and by questioning established canons of comparative inquiry, Gran encourages people to recognize the similarities between the West and non-West nations.",['Peter Gran'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M2cZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=M2cZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Beyond+Eurocentrism:+A+New+View+of+Modern+World+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Syracuse University Press,2021-02-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M2cZEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/904_Beyond_Eurocentrism__A_New_View_of_Modern_World_History.jpg,History,1

"War to the Knife: Bleeding Kansas, 1854-1861","Marching armies, cavalry raids, guerilla warfare, massacres, towns and farms in flames—the American Civil War, 1861-1865? No—Kansas, 1854-1861. Before there was Bull Run or Gettysburg, there was Black Jack and Osawatomie. Long before events at Fort Sumter ignited the War Between the States, men fought and died on the Prairies of Kansas over the incendiary issue of slavery. “War to the knife and knife to the hilt,” cried the Atchison Squatter Sovereign. “ Let the watchword be ‘Extermination, total and complete.’” In 1854 a shooting war developed between proslavery men in Missouri and free-staters in Kansas over control of the territory. The prize was whether it would be a slave or free state when admitted to the Union, a question that could decide the balance of power in Washington. Told in the unforgettable words of the men and women involved, War to the Knife is an absorbing account of a bloody episode soon spread east, events in “Bleeding Kansas” have largely been forgotten. But as historian Thomas Goodrich reveals in this compelling saga, what America’s “first civil war” lacked in numbers it more than made up for in ferocity. War to the Knife is a riveting story of blood, fire, and death. It is also a story with an impressive cast of characters: Robert E Lee, William Tecumseh Sherman, Sara Robinson, Jeb Stuart, Abraham Lincoln, Horace Greeley, Julia Lovejoy, William F. Cody. These and more step forward to tell their tale. And casting his long, dark shadow over al is the strange, haunting figure of John Brown—hailed as a prophet by some, denounced as a madman by others.",['Thomas Goodrich'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iv2EDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=iv2EDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=War+to+the+Knife:+Bleeding+Kansas,+1854-1861&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Stackpole Books,2018-03-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iv2EDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],2.0,book_covers/746_War_to_the_Knife__Bleeding_Kansas__1854-1861.jpg,History,1

But anyone who’s been a believer long enough has likely experienced seasons that feel more mundane or routine, leading to aimlessly skimming a couple of Bible verses or praying the same prayer over and over. In Be Thou My Vision, Jonathan Gibson has created a 31-day liturgical guide designed to provide structure to the daily worship of individuals and families. Each daily reading includes a call to worship, adoration, confession, assurance, creed and catechism, the Gloria Patri, a prayer of illumination, Bible reading, intercessory prayer, and the Lord’s Prayer. Designed to be read in 15–20 minutes a day, this beautifully produced liturgy will give readers focus and purpose to their daily quiet time while teaching them historical prayers, creeds, and catechisms that point them to Christ.",['Jonathan Gibson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9eFDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9eFDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Draw+Me+Close+to+You:+Daily+Devotions+from+the+Greatest+Praise+and+Worship+Songs+of+All+Time+(Songs+4+Worship+(Hardcover))&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crossway,2021-12-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9eFDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/350_Draw_Me_Close_to_You__Daily_Devotions_from_the_Greatest_Praise_and_Worship_Songs_of_All_Time__Songs_4_Worship__Hardcover__.jpg,Religion,2
The American Mayor: The Best & the Worst Big-City Leaders,"The American Mayor offers a unique ranking of the nation's big-city mayors by expert scholars. Although the mayoralty is one of the most important political executive offices, it has escaped the kind of evaluations by which scholars have ranked American presidents. Now, thanks to Melvin Holli, we have a comparable survey of the ""best"" and ""worst"" mayors, covering some 730 mayors from the big-fifteen cities, from the beginning of the modern office in 1820 to the 1990s. The poll of historians, biographers, and social scientists produced a remarkably strong consensus. Who were our best mayors? The list ranges from Boston's ""Great Mayor"" Josiah Quincy (1823–1828) to New York City's Fiorello La Guardia (1934–1945), who is first on the all-time-best list. La Guardia, a stouthearted fireplug of a man, built modern New York, fought Murder Incorporated, read the comics to children over the air during a newspaper strike, and was a symbol of ethnic probity and honesty. Sandwiched between Quincy and La Guardia are several other outstanding mayors, including Cleveland's Tom Johnson (1901–1909), Pittsburgh's David Lawrence (1946–1959), Detroit's Hazen Pingree (1890–1897), and Los Angeles's Tom Bradley (1973–1993). Taking the first-worst prize among scoundrel mayors is Chicago's William H. ""Big Bill"" Thompson (1915–1923, 1927–1931), one of the most colorful mayors in the city's history, if not the most corrupt. Big Bill, also known as ""Kaiser Bill"" for his pro-German stand during World War I, accepted campaign funds from gangsters including Al Capone. Also among the ""worst"" is another Chicago mayor, Jane Byrne (1979–1983), the only woman on the list. Jersey City's Frank Hague (1917–1947) and Philadelphia's Frank Rizzo (1972–1980) are among the other notable rascals who have sat in city halls. The American Mayor presents complete findings of Holli's poll in jargon-free fashion. Holli explains the results of the survey, gives biographical sketches of the ten best mayors, as well as some attention to the worst, and then uses the findings of modern leadership studies to explore mayoral success and failure. He concludes with a chapter titled ""Pathways to Power,"" in which he reviews the New York City political milieu that produced the nation's ""best"" mayor, Fiorello La Guardia, and also examines the career of the nation's most successful big-city mayor, Buffalo's Grover Cleveland, the only mayor to become president of the United States.",['Melvin G.

Preacher As Risk Taker,"Many individuals take risks in life such as mountain climbers, magicians, farmers, and gamblers. But do we ever include preachers in that category? Preachers have opportunities to be some of the greatest risk takers. In Preacher as Risk Taker, Richard Hart, O.F.M. Cap., challenges preachers to be on the cutting edge by taking risks resulting in better preaching. How many preachers are willing to submit their homilies to an editor or have their homilies taped? Are poetic preachers ready to preach in a changing Church? How often do preachers discuss social sin, the environment, ageing, the reign of God, or Paul's epistles? Do today's preachers realize how important it is to preach through healing or Jesus as a wisdom figure? Finally, do preachers know the true difference between a eulogy and a homily? Hart offers insight to each of these questions for preachers interested in improving their homilies. Preachers might not be asked to scale a mountain or act as a magician. But preachers are asked to take similar risks when preaching on challenging topics. In Preacher as Risk Taker, Father Hart provides answers for those interested in becoming spirited preachers.",['Richard Hart'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZfwSaAzYON0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ZfwSaAzYON0C&pg=PA20&dq=Preacher+As+Risk+Taker&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Liturgical Press,2003,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZfwSaAzYON0C&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/571_Preacher_As_Risk_Taker.jpg,Religion,2

Senator Joe McCarthy,"Accused of creating a bogus Red Scare and smearing countless innocent victims in a five-year reign of terror, Senator Joseph McCarthy is universally remembered as a demagogue, a bully, and a liar. History has judged him such a loathsome figure that even today, a half century after his death, his name remains synonymous with witch hunts. But that conventional image is all wrong, as veteran journalist and author M. Stanton Evans reveals in this groundbreaking book. The long-awaited Blacklisted by History, based on six years of intensive research, dismantles the myths surrounding Joe McCarthy and his campaign to unmask Communists, Soviet agents, and flagrant loyalty risks working within the U.S. government. Evans’s revelations completely overturn our understanding of McCarthy, McCarthyism, and the Cold War. Drawing on primary sources—including never-before-published government records and FBI files, as well as recent research gleaned from Soviet archives and intercepted transmissions between Moscow spymasters and their agents in the United States—Evans presents irrefutable evidence of a relentless Communist drive to penetrate our government, influence its policies, and steal its secrets. Most shocking of all, he shows that U.S. officials supposedly guarding against this danger not only let it happen but actively covered up the penetration. All of this was precisely as Joe McCarthy contended.Blacklisted by History shows, for instance, that the FBI knew as early as 1942 that J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the atomic bomb project, had been identified by Communist leaders as a party member; that high-level U.S. officials were warned that Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy almost a decade before the Hiss case became a public scandal; that a cabal of White House, Justice Department, and State Department officials lied about and covered up the Amerasia spy case; and that the State Department had been heavily penetrated by Communists and Soviet agents before McCarthy came on the scene.Evans also shows that practically everything we’ve been told about McCarthy is false, including conventional treatment of the famous 1950 speech at Wheeling, West Virginia, that launched the McCarthy era (“I have here in my hand . . .”), the Senate hearings that casually dismissed his charges, the matter of leading McCarthy suspect Owen Lattimore, the Annie Lee Moss case, the Army-McCarthy hearings, and much more. In the end, Senator McCarthy was censured by his colleagues and condemned by the press and historians. But as Evans writes, “The real Joe McCarthy has vanished into the mists of fable and recycled error, so that it takes the equivalent of a dragnet search to find him.” Blacklisted by History provides the first accurate account of what McCarthy did and, more broadly, what happened to America during the Cold War. It is a revealing exposé of the forces that distorted our national policy in that conflict and our understanding of its history since.",['M.

The Children of Noah,"Here the late Raphael Patai (1910-1996) recreates the fascinating world of Jewish seafaring from Noah's voyage through the Diaspora of late antiquity. In a work of pioneering scholarship, Patai weaves together Biblical stories, Talmudic lore, and Midrash literature to bring alive the world of these ancient mariners. As he did in his highly acclaimed book The Jewish Alchemists, Patai explores a subject that has never before been investigated by scholars. Based on nearly sixty years of research, beginning with study he undertook for his doctoral dissertation, The Children of Noah is literally Patai's first book and his last. It is a work of unsurpassed scholarship, but it is accessible to general readers as well as scholars. An abundance of evidence demonstrates the importance of the sea in the lives of Jews throughout early recorded history. Jews built ships, sailed them, fought wars in them, battled storms in them, and lost their lives to the sea. Patai begins with the story of the deluge that is found in Genesis and profiles Noah, the father of all shipbuilders and seafarers. The sea, according to Patai's interpretation, can be seen as an image of the manifestation of God's power, and he reflects on its role in legends and tales of early times. The practical importance of the sea also led to the development of practical institutions, and Patai shows how Jewish seafaring had its own culture and how it influenced the cultures of Mediterranean life as well. Of course, Jewish sailors were subject to the same rabbinical laws as Jews who never set sail, and Patai describes how they went to extreme lengths to remain in adherence, even getting special emendations of laws to allow them to tie knots and adjust rigging on the Sabbath. The Children of Noah is a capstone to an extraordinary career. Patai was both a careful scholar and a gifted storyteller, and this work is at once a vivid history of a neglected aspect of Jewish culture and a treasure trove of sources for further study. It is a stimulating and delightful book.",['Raphael Patai'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vcQIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=vcQIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Children+of+Noah&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2021-02-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vcQIEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/943_The_Children_of_Noah.jpg,History,1

The U-2 Spyplane: Toward the Unknown: A New History of the Early Years,"The full story of the development and early use of the U-2 has never been properly told until now. This book describes in vivid detail how the high-flying spyplane was conceived, designed, built, and deployed in record time. It explains why the CIA, and not the U.S. Air Force, controlled the project. It traces how the Iron Curtain was pried apart by the epic overflights of denied territory from 1956 to 1960. It discusses why these flights were needed, what they were looking for, and how the intelligence they returned was processed and analyzed. Readers are taken inside the Soviet Unions military machine, as it developed new strategic weapons and (eventually) the means to shoot the U-2 down. The book also explores the political dimension, telling how President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev each faced the challenge of the U-2 flights albeit from very different perspectives. Toward the Unknown will appeal to students of aviation and intelligence history, and to anyone wishing to learn more about a key episode in the Cold War.",['Chris Pocock'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yA2RNwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=yA2RNwAACAAJ&dq=The+U-2+Spyplane:+Toward+the+Unknown:+A+New+History+of+the+Early+Years&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Schiffer Publishing,2000,http://books.google.nl/books?id=yA2RNwAACAAJ&dq=The+U-2+Spyplane:+Toward+the+Unknown:+A+New+History+of+the+Early+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/876_The_U-2_Spyplane__Toward_the_Unknown__A_New_History_of_the_Early_Years.jpg,History,1

The Italian campaign (World War II),"This work focuses on the all black 92nd Infantry Division in the Italian Campaign in World War II and the poor combat performance of the division in Italy. An introduction provides an overall view of the Italian Campaign and the role of the 92nd Infantry Division. The author then examines the reasons for the division’s troubles on and off the battlefield, such as the low morale among the soldiers because of racial segregation, the limited facilities provided for them, and their lack of trust in their leadership. All of these issues are explored at length. Information on the early life and military training and experience of General Ned Almond is provided, along with the stories of Vernon Baker and John Fox, who emerged as leaders but endured a long struggle for recognition. The author concludes this work on a personal note by telling of his involvement as principal investigator of Acting Secretary of the Army John Shannon’s study of why no African American received the Medal of Honor in World War II (a situation that was rectified in the late 1990s: See Elliott V.

The Battle for Rome,"In September 1943, the German army marched into Rome, beginning an occupation that would last nine months until Allied forces liberated the ancient city. During those 270 days, clashing factions -- the occupying Germans, the Allies, the growing resistance movement, and the Pope -- contended for control over the destiny of the Eternal City. In The Battle for Rome, Robert Katz vividly recreates the drama of the occupation and offers new information from recently declassified documents to explain the intentions of the rival forces. One of the enduring myths of World War II is the legend that Rome was an ""open city,"" free from military activity. In fact the German occupation was brutal, beginning almost immediately with the first roundup of Jews in Italy. Rome was a strategic prize that the Germans and the Allies fought bitterly to win. The Allied advance up the Italian peninsula from Salerno and Anzio in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war was designed to capture the Italian capital. Dominating the city in his own way was Pope Pius XII, who used his authority in a ceaseless effort to spare Rome, especially the Vatican and the papal properties, from destruction. But historical documents demonstrate that the Pope was as concerned about the Partisans as he was about the Nazis, regarding the Partisans as harbingers of Communism in the Eternal City. The Roman Resistance was a coalition of political parties that agreed on little beyond liberating Rome, but the Partisans, the organized military arm of the coalition, became increasingly active and effective as the occupation lengthened. Katz tells the story of two young Partisans, Elena and Paolo, who fought side by side, became lovers, and later played a central role in the most significant guerrilla action of the occupation. In retaliation for this action, the Germans committed the Ardeatine Caves Massacre, slaying hundreds of Roman men and boys. The Pope's decision not to intervene in that atrocity has been a source of controversy and debate among historians for decades, but drawing on Vatican documents, Katz authoritatively examines the matter. Katz takes readers into the occupied city to witness the desperate efforts of the key actors: OSS undercover agent Peter Tompkins, struggling to forge an effective spy network among the Partisans; German diplomats, working against their own government to save Rome even as they condoned the Nazi repression of its citizens; Pope Pius XII, anxiously trying to protect the Vatican at the risk of depending on the occupying Germans, who maintained order by increasingly draconian measures; and the U.S. and British commanders, who disagreed about the best way to engage the enemy, turning the final advance into a race to be first to take Rome. The Battle for Rome is a landmark work that draws on newly released documents and firsthand testimony gathered over decades to offer the finest account yet of one of the most dramatic episodes of World War II.",['Robert Katz'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8WHDVZPscVIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=8WHDVZPscVIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Battle+for+Rome&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2010-05-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8WHDVZPscVIC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/976_The_Battle_for_Rome.jpg,History,1

The Sermon on the Mount,"Too often the Sermon on the Mount has been interpreted as though it were a book itself rather than a portion of a book. Dale Allison insists on the contrary that the full meaning of these chapters in Matthew's Gospel can be seen only in relation to the broader literary context of the Gospel as a whole, with its Jewish Christian orientation. Indeed, the Sermon and the moral imperatives it contains must be understood: 1) in relation to the example provided by Jesus' words and deeds elsewhere in the Gospel; 2) with reference to the community of believers that constitutes the intended audience of Matthew's Gospel; and 3) in terms of what the Gospel says elsewhere about the end of the age. The Sermon does not present a simple set of rules, perhaps only intended for a small and select group within the Christian community, but seeks to instill a moral vision and to inspire the moral imagination of all who would follow Jesus.",['Dale C.

Palace Wagon Family : A True Story of the Donner Party,"The Donner party is the name given to a group of emigrants, including the families of George Donner and his brother Jacob, who became trapped in the Sierra Nevada mountains during the winter of 1846-1847.

Free Frank: A Black Pioneer on the Antebellum Frontier,"The story of Free Frank is not only a testament to human courage and resourcefulness but affords new insight into the American frontier. Born a slave in the South Carolina piedmont in 1777, Frank died a free man in 1854 in a town he had founded in western Illinois. His accomplishments, creditable for any frontiersman, were for a black man extraordinary. We first learn details of Frank's life when in 1795 his owner moved to Pulaski County, Kentucky. We know that he married Lucy, a slave on a neighboring farm, in 1799. Later he was allowed to hire out his time, and when his owner moved to Tennessee, Frank was left in charge of the Kentucky farm. During the War of 1812, he set up his own saltpeter works, an enterprise he maintained until he left Kentucky. In 1817 he purchased his wife's freedom for $800; two years later he bought his own liberty for the same price. Now free, he expanded his activities, purchasing land and dealing in livestock. With his wife and four of his children, Free Frank left Kentucky in 1830 to settle on a new frontier. In Pike County, Illinois, he purchased a farm and later, in 1836, platted and successfully promoted the town of New Philadelphia. The desire for freedom was an obvious spur to his commercial efforts. Through his lifetime of work he purchased the liberty of sixteen members of his family at a cost of nearly $14,000. Goods and services commanded a premium in the life of the frontier. Free Frank's career shows what an exceptional man, through working against great odds, could accomplish through industry, acumen, and aggressiveness. His story suggests a great deal about business activity and legal practices, as well as racial conditions, on the frontier. Juliet Walker has performed a task of historical detection in recreating the life of Free Frank from family traditions, limited personal papers, public documents, and secondary sources. In doing so, she has added a significant chapter to the history of African Americans.",['Juliet E.K.

Confederate Courage on Other Fields: Four Lesser Known Accounts of the War Between the States,"While many soldiers in the army of the Confederate States of America fought on famous fields like Gettysburg and Antietam, others demonstrated equal valor in lesser known places. Here are collected, for the first time, the accounts of four little known pieces of Confederate history. These four pieces are important components in understanding Confederate life in both small and large scale. The first section concerns the battle of Dinwiddie Court House on March 31, 1865, the last significant Confederate victory and the prelude to the battle of Five Forks the next day. The second section chronicles the experiences of Col. Charles C. Blacknall of the 23rd North Carolina Infantry, whose letters offer insight into the life of an officer and his personal struggles before his death from wounds received at the battle of Winchester. The third section examines a tragic and bloody series of conflicts and retaliations in southeast Missouri that demonstrated the revenge and violence against civilians that often erupted during the war. Finally, the history of General Hospital Number One, at Kittrell Springs, is analyzed, including accounts from the hospital's chaplain and its chief surgeon, and many of the last words they recorded in the performance of their duties. These four accounts illustrate very personal experiences of war by Confederate soldiers, in their own words from letters and diaries, period and contemporary photographs, and maps.",['Mark J.

The Story of Christianity: The Early Church to the Present Day,"Beginning with the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century, this second volume of The Story of Christianity continues narrative history to the present. Historian Justo Gonzalez brings to life the people, dramatic events, and shaping ideas of Protestantism, Catholicism, and Orthodoxy during this period, keynoting crucial theological developments while providing fresh understanding of the social, political, and economic forces that influenced the formation of the church. In particular, the author notes recurring themes of unrest, rebellion, and reformation. Gonzalez presents an illuminating record of the lives, impelling ideas, and achievements of such prominent figures as Martin Luther, Ulrich Zwingli, and John Calvin––movers and shapers in the emerging Protestant church. His biographical insights, in conjunction with vivid historical accounts, reveal how individual lives mirror and clarify core theological concerns and developments. The interpretive overview of The Story of Christianity includes a thorough and timely analysis of the growth and maturation of Christianity, including events in Europe, the United States, and Latin America––the latter an area too often neglected in church histories, yet increasingly vital to an understanding of Christianity's historical development, present situation, and future, options. Gonzalez's richly textured study discusses the changes and directions of the church in the traditions of Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, and Eastern Christianity. The Story of Christianity covers such recent occurrences as the World Council of Churches, the Second Vatican Council, the movement toward Christian unity, and much more. It concludes with a thoughtful look at the major issues and debates involving Christians today.",['Justo L.

Wars of the Roses Pb (History and Politics),"The Wars of the Roses (c. 1455-1487) are renowned as an infamously savage and tangled slice of English history. A bloody thirty-year struggle between the dynastic houses of Lancaster and York, they embraced localised vendetta (such as the bitter northern feud between the Percies and Nevilles) as well as the formal clash of royalist and rebel armies at St Albans, Ludford Bridge, Mortimer's Cross, Towton, Tewkesbury and finally Bosworth, when the usurping Yorkist king, Richard III, was crushed by Henry Tudor. Powerful personalities dominate the period: the charismatic and enigmatic Richard III, immortalized by Shakespeare; the slippery Warwick, the Kingmaker', who finally over-reached ambition to be cut down at the Battle of Barnet; and guileful women like Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret of Anjou, who for a time ruled the kingdom in her husband's stead. David Grummitt places the violent events of this complex time in the wider context of fifteenth-century kingship and the development of English political culture.Never losing sight of the traumatic impact of war on the lives of those who either fought in or were touched by battle, this captivating new history will make compelling reading for students of the late medieval period and Tudor England, as well as for general readers.",['David Grummitt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QsqJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QsqJDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR6&dq=Wars+of+the+Roses+Pb+(History+and+Politics)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2014-01-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QsqJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/830_Wars_of_the_Roses_Pb__History_and_Politics_.jpg,History,1

Judas Child,"It is three days before Christmas, and two young girls have disappeared from the local academy. This hasn’t happened for fifteen years, since Rouge Kendall’s twin sister was murdered. The killer was found, but now Rouge, twenty-five and a policeman, is forced to wonder: Was he really the one? Also wondering is a former classmate named Ali Cray, a forensic psychologist with scars of her own. The pattern is the same, she says: a child called out to meet a friend. The friend is the bait, the Judas child, and is quickly killed. But the primary victim lives longer...until Christmas Day. Rouge doesn’t want to hear this. He’s spent the last fifteen years trying to avoid the memories: drinking alone, lying low, washing out of school and a promising first career. Now he might abandon law enforcement too—but something won’t let him, not yet. A little girl has haunted his dreams all these years—and he has three days finally to put her to rest.","[""Carol O'Connell""]",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MYvdG2jbZWQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=MYvdG2jbZWQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Judas+Child&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2010-06-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MYvdG2jbZWQC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],13.0,book_covers/75_Judas_Child.jpg,Fiction,0
The Colour of Memory,"The first novel, in revised form, from ""possibly the best living writer in Britain"" (The Daily Telegraph) In The Colour of Memory, six friends plot a nomadic course through their mid-twenties as they scratch out an existence in near-destitute conditions in 1980s South London. They while away their hours drinking cheap beer, landing jobs and quickly squandering them, smoking weed, dodging muggings, listening to Coltrane, finding and losing a facsimile of love, collecting unemployment, and discussing politics in the way of the besotted young—as if they were employed only by the lives they chose.

The Doll Factory is a sweeping tale of curiosity, love, and possession set among all the sordidness and soaring ambition of 1850s London. The greatest spectacle London has ever seen is being erected in Hyde Park and, among the crowd watching, two people meet. For Iris, an aspiring artist of unique beauty, it is the encounter of a moment—forgotten seconds later—but for Silas, a curiosity collector enchanted by the strange and beautiful, the meeting marks a new beginning. When Iris is asked to model for Pre-Raphaelite artist Louis Frost, she agrees on the condition that he will also teach her to paint, and suddenly her world expands beyond anything she ever dreamed of. But she has no idea that evil stalks her.

The Collegeville Atlas of the Bible,"2000 Catholic Press Association Award Winner! The Collegeville atlas of the Bible offers those with an interest in their historical and religious heritage a guided tour through the Bible. It describes the stories and events of the Bible and places them in their historical and geographical context. Fabulous 3-D cutaways, maps, and ground plans, all based on the latest historical evidence, enhance the comprehensive text and bring the dramatic events of the Old and New Testaments to life in glorious detail. When the Bible says that Abraham migrated from Ur, Jacob fled to Haran, and Jesus healed and taught in Galilee, many people think of these places as merely names with a semi-legendary status. But with recent archaeology, sites such as Jericho, Hazor, Megiddo, and Masada are now living monuments to the dramatic action described in the Bible. The Collegeville atlas of the Bible illustrates the most important of these sites, while capturing the atmosphere of biblical times with graphic reconstructions, and photographs of archeological remains and biblical artifacts. The Collegeville atlas of the Bible begins with the events of Genesis and follows the sequence of the biblical books, ending with Revelation. The main text gives succinct outlines of biblical stories and explains points of theology. Special features, such as The making of the Psalms"" and *Modern Bedouin Encampments, - shed fascinating light on a variety of topics. Central to The Collegeville atlas of the Bible is its use of 50 maps (route maps, ground plans, and locators) to detail biblical territories and routes, and to pinpoint the locations of important events. In the Old Testament, for example, a Mesopotamian ziggurat will show how the Tower of Babel might have looked, while Solomon's Temple is shown in al its magnificence. In the New Testament, the city of Jerusalem and the siege of Masada are among the visual panoramas presented. In addition, feature map spreads show major journeys and empires, and location shots add their own authentic vistas. Specially-commissioned reconstructions and beautifully illustrated reflective page spreads build on this foundation to add contextual information to the discussion of biblical stories. Additionally, 300 superb full-color photographs take the reader to the Holy Land as it is today in order to better understand how it was in biblical times. The Collegeville atlas of the Bible is divided into two main sections corresponding to the Bible itself: The Old Testament In the Beginning The Patriarchs To the Promised Land From Judges to Kings Decline, Fall and Restoration The Hellenistic Age The New Testament Jesus's Early Life The Ministry of Jesus Death and Resurrection The First Christians Revolution and Revelation Special features: Specially-commissioned 3-D artworks and ground plans based on the most up-to-date archaeological finds reconstruct the palaces, cities, and towns chronicled in the Bible. Expert text explains the stories of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, explaining the history and the theology related to each one. Carefully selected quotations are taken from the Bible, alongside quotations from other historical sources, for a new angle on these ancient stories. Detailed relief maps show the routes of individuals and the movements of peoples, from Abraham's first journey in Mesopotamia to the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, to Paul's last journey to Rome. Detailed descriptions and images of surviving artifacts prompt discussion of aspects of everyday life in the Holy Land. Fully illustrated reflective spreads add a thoughtful discussion of many biblical stories. Authoritative and comprehensive, its 50 maps, 18 major artworks, and 300 full-color photographs make this atlas of the Bible a visual feast. Will appeal to anyone interested in archaeology and ancient history, especially the cultures of ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and the splendid empires of the Middle East. Marcus Braybrooke is a Church of England vicar and co-president of the World Congress of Faiths. He has written several books about the Bible, Judaism, and interfaith relations.

The creepers,"CREEPERS, David Morrell's gripping joyride of a thriller, depicts every harrowing second in eight hours of relentless terror. A New York Times bestseller, it received the prestigious Stoker Award from the Horror Writers Association. On a cold October night, five people gather in a run-down motel on the New Jersey shore and begin preparations to break in to the Paragon Hotel. Built in the glory days of Asbury Park by a reclusive millionaire, the magnificent structure—which foreshadowed the beauties of art-deco architecture—is now boarded up and marked for demolition. The five people are ""creepers,"" the slang term for urban explorers: city archeologists with a passion for investigating abandoned buildings and their dying secrets. On this evening, they are joined by a reporter who wants to profile them—anonymously, as this is a highly illegal activity—for a New York Times article. Frank Balenger isn't looking for just a story, however. And after the group enters the rat-infested tunnel leading to the hotel, it becomes clear that he will get much more than he bargained for. Danger, terror, and death await the creepers in a place ravaged by time and redolent of evil. The darkest secrets live in places you’re not supposed to be. “Chilling.” —Stephen King, New York Times bestselling author of Doctor Sleep “Crack this novel, and it’s like an alien abduction of your brain—forget resuming your normal life until it’s finished. This will be a classic.”—Douglas Preston, New York Times bestselling co-author (with Lincoln Child) of White Fire “With its nonstop cascade of ingeniously contrived dangers and assaults, culminating in an apocalyptic finale, Creepers provides the essence of all thrillers, an intense emotional effect that will leave readers drained.”—Washington Post",['David Morrell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o26UAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=o26UAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+creepers&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,David Morrell ,2011-06-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o26UAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/309_The_creepers.jpg,Fiction,0

A history of Finland,"Henrik Meinander paints a brisk and bold picture of the history of Finland from integrated part of the Swedish kingdom to autonomous Grand Duchy within the Russian empire, gradually transformed and maturing into a conscious nation, independent state and skilful adapter of modern technology. The main geographical context for his study is the Baltic region, and the author links his analysis to structural developments and turning points in European history. The book blends politics, economy and culture to show how human and natural resources in Finland have been utilized and the impact its cultural heritage and technological innovation have had on its development. In a departure from most conventional approaches, Meinander gives greater emphasis to recent and contemporary events.

The Five Aggregates: Understanding Theravada Psychology and Soteriology (Editions SR),"If Buddhism denies a permanent self, how does it perceive identity? According to Buddhist texts, the entire universe, including the individual, is made up of different phenomena, which Buddhism classifies into different categories: what we conventionally call a “person” can be understood in terms of five aggregates, the sum of which must not be taken for a permanent entity, since beings are nothing but an amalgam of ever-changing phenomena. Although the aggregates are only a “convenient fiction,” the Buddha nevertheless made frequent use of the aggregate scheme when asked to explain the elements at work in the individual. In this study Mathieu Boisvert presents a detailed analysis of the five aggregates (pañcakkhandhā) and establishes how the Theravda tradition views their interaction. He clarifies the fundamentals of Buddhist psychology by providing a rigorous examination of the nature and interrelation of each of the aggregates and by establishing, for the first time, how the function of each of these aggregates chains beings to the cycle of birth, death and rebirth — the theory of dependent origination (paticcasamuppāda). Boisvert contends that without a thorough understanding of the five aggregates, we cannot grasp the liberation process at work within the individual, who is, after all, simply an amalgam of the five aggregates. The Five Aggregates represents an important and original contribution to Buddhist studies and will be of great interest to all scholars and students of Buddhism.",['Mathieu Boisvert'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jl49DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Jl49DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Five+Aggregates:+Understanding+Theravada+Psychology+and+Soteriology+(Editions+SR)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

Night Has a Thousand Eyes,"In Woolrich's iconic tale, Detective Tom Shawn saves a lovely young woman from a suicide attempt one night, and later hears her story. She is in despair because the death of her wealthy father has been predicted by a confident man seemingly gifted with the power of clairvoyance; a man whose predictions have unerringly aided her father in his business many times before. Shawn and a squad of detectives investigate this dire prediction and try to avert the millionaire businessman from meeting his ordained end at the stroke of midnight.

Man and the Incarnation,"Wingren claims that in a theologian like Irenaeus there are parts of the Biblical message which are interpreted in greater clarity and power than in any later period of Christian thought. As such, this book deserves the sympathetic attention of theologians both Catholic and Protestant. To summarize it is nearly impossible in view of the richness and fullness of the discussion. We may say, however, that for Irenaeus God made man for growth, yet man was defeated by that Satan whom God also created. The Son of God served to recapitulate and reverse Adam's fall and to restore humanity's lost God-given potentiality for growth. In the Church, through word and sacrament, Christ's benefits are made available to all. In the final consummation, when man becomes like God he is in actual fact becoming man. God and man are not fundamentally in opposition to one another. The only thing to add about Wingren's book is that it must be read. There are very few studies of classical Christian theology which come close to it in clarity, completeness, or convincing power.",['Gustaf Wingren'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DipLAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=DipLAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Man+and+the+Incarnation&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2004-09-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DipLAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/403_Man_and_the_Incarnation.jpg,Religion,2

Zipper: An Exploration in Novelty (Reprint),"At its dawn in the early twentieth century, the new technology of aviation posed a crucial question to American and British cavalry: what do we do with the airplane? Lacking the hindsight of historical perspective, cavalry planners based their decisions on incomplete information. Harnessing the Airplane compares how the American and British armies dealt with this unique challenge. A multilayered look at a critical aspect of modern industrial warfare, this book examines the ramifications of technological innovation and its role in the fraught relationship that developed between traditional ground units and emerging air forces. Cavalry officers pondered the potential military uses of airplanes and other new technologies early on, but preferred to test them before embracing and incorporating them in their operations. Cavalrymen cautiously examined airplane capabilities, developed applications and doctrine for joint operations, and in the United States, even tried to develop their own, specially designed craft. Throughout the interwar period, instead of replacing the cavalry, airplanes were used cooperatively with cavalry forces in reconnaissance, security, communication, protection, and pursuit—a collaboration tested in maneuvers and officially blessed in both British and American doctrine. This interdependent relationship changed drastically, however, during the 1930s as aviation priorities and doctrine shifted from tactical support of ground troops toward independent strategic bombardment. Henning shows that the American and British experiences with military aviation differed. The nascent British aviation service made quicker inroads into reconnaissance and scouting, even though the British cavalry was the older institution with more-established traditions. The American cavalry, despite its youth, contested the control of reconnaissance as late as the 1930s, years after similar arguments ended in Britain. Drawing on contemporary government reports, memoirs and journals of service personnel, books, and professional and trade journals and magazines, Harnessing the Airplane is a nuanced account of the cavalry’s response to aviation over time and presents a new perspective on a significant chapter of twentieth-century military history.",['Lori A.

Though often somber, Sword of Honor is also a brilliant comedy, peopled by the fantastic figures so familiar from Waugh's early satires.

Is the Bible True?: How Modern Debates and Discoveries Affirm the Essence of the Scriptures,"In this lucid, insightful work, U.S. News & World Report religion writer Jeffrey L. Sheler draws upon years of investigation and in-depth interviews to tackle such controversial subjects as the recent Jesus Seminar, modern biblical archaeology, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the mysterious Bible codes. This solid exploration into some of the thorniest aspects of current debates about the Bible and religion concludes with a message of reassurance about historical accuracy, validity, and integrity of the Scriptures. Sheler's bold but balanced investigation discloses a Bible still worthy of belief in a modern age. In this authoritative book, renowned U.S. News & World Report religion writer Jeffrey L. Sheler sifts through the claims and counterclaims of contemporary biblical studies. After carefully investigating the full spectrum of cutting-edge research and conflicting reports, he challenges the popular perception that the credibility of the Bible has been seriously undermined by critical scholarship. Rather, he concludes that the weight of the historical evidence upholds the essential truth of Exodus, the Gospel accounts of Jesus, and other vital elements of the Bible. The author draws extensively from his own interviews with leading Bible experts and on-site reports from Israel and Egypt in his examination of scholarship's hot-button issues, including: Dramatic archaeological discoveries that both affirm and challenge the history in the Bible. The controversial quest for the historical Jesus and its sometimes flawed arguments and skeptical assumptions regarding the reliability of the Gospels. The amazing revelations of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient texts that profoundly influence our understanding of the Bible. The mysterious phenomenon of The Bible Code and why there may be far less to its doomsday prophesies than meets the eye. Sheler's considerable experience as a leading religion journalist enables him to get to the heart of the issues without the jargon. Written in clear, compelling prose, Is the Bible True?

"A Middle East Mosaic: Fragments of Life, Letters, and History","In times of war and in peace, from the earliest days of the Roman Empire to our own, Westerners have journeyed to the lands of the middle east, bringing back accounts of their adventures and impressions. Yet it was never a one way exchange. From the first Arab embassy to the Vikings in the 9th century to the internet musings of the Taliban, A Middle East Mosaic collects a rich, boisterous literature of cultural exchange. We see the American Revolution through the eyes of a Moroccan Ambassador and the French Revolution through a series of Imperial Ottoman proclamations. We find surprising portraits of Napoleon (""a brigand chief""), TE Lawrence and Ataturk. We learn what George Washington and Machiavelli through t of Turkish politics and hear Flaubert and Thackeray rail against eastern crime and punishment. We peer into Voltaire's business correspondence and follow the footsteps of Mark Twain, Richard Burton, Gertrude Bell and Ibn Battutta, the Marco Polo of the east. Great discoveries are recorded - an Egyptian Ambassador is introduced to electricity and dismisses the spectacle as ""frankish trickery;"" another pronounces the invention of a secure mail system most useful for assignations. We enter the harem with a 16th century organ maker and emerge with Ottoman reform. It was not until the sixteenth century that the first middle eastern rulers entered into diplomatic relations with European rulers, but trade often precede diplomatic relations. Business men from the days of the crusades against Saladin to the oil prospecting of Samuel Cox and his descendents have seen great possibilities in the markets of the middle east. And throughout the centuries we have been united by war. We witness the outbreak of the Crimean war with Karl Marx and enter Egypt with Napoleon. We observe Arab customs with George Patton and visit Baghdad and Cairo with George F. Kennan in the second world war. When Usama bin Ladin rails against ""Jews and crusaders"" occupying the holy land, he is rehearsing a grievance with a long history. This symphony of voices, full of wit and wisdom, spite and wonder, suspicion, befuddlement and occasional insight, is ordered and explained by our foremost living historian of the middle east. The fruit of a lifetime of scholarship and erudition, A Middle East Mosaic is a dazzling capstone to a brilliant career. In a spirited reappraisal of western views of the east and eastern views of the west over the last two thousand years, Bernard Lewis gives us a brilliant over-view of 2,000 years of commerce, diplomacy, war and exploration. This book is a delight, a treasury of stories drawn from letters, diaries and histories, but also from unpublished archives and previously untranslated accounts. Diplomats and interpreters, slaves, soldiers, pilgrims and missionaries, princes and spies, businessmen, doctors and priests all pour forth their stories of the people and events that shaped history. A Middle East Mosaic cannot fail to appeal to anyone with an appetite for history and a curiosity about the vagaries of cultural exchange.",['Bernard Lewis'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VudI81drMBoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=VudI81drMBoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Middle+East+Mosaic:+Fragments+of+Life,+Letters,+and+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Modern Library,2007-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VudI81drMBoC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/990_A_Middle_East_Mosaic__Fragments_of_Life__Letters__and_History.jpg,History,1
THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.,"Edgar Allan Poe's The Murders in the Rue Morgue represents the beginning of crime fiction. The mystery was first published in Graham's Magazine in 1841 and has been recognized as the first detective story. Poe referred to it as one of his ""tales of ratiocination."" As the first fictional detective, Poe's Dupin displays many traits which became literary conventions in subsequent fictional detectives including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. Many later characters, for example, follow Poe's model of the brilliant detective, his personal friend who serves as narrator, and the final revelation being presented before the reasoning that leads up to it. Dupin himself reappears in The Mystery of Marie Rog t and The Purloined Letter.",['Edgar Allan Poe'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UVD6DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UVD6DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=THE+MURDERS+IN+THE+RUE+MORGUE.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Lulu.com,2017-01-21,http://books.google.com/books?id=UVD6DQAAQBAJ&dq=THE+MURDERS+IN+THE+RUE+MORGUE.&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],35.0,book_covers/40_THE_MURDERS_IN_THE_RUE_MORGUE_.jpg,Fiction,0
the bridge at andau,"The Bridge at Andau is James A. Michener at his most gripping. His classic nonfiction account of a doomed uprising is as searing and unforgettable as any of his bestselling novels. For five brief, glorious days in the autumn of 1956, the Hungarian revolution gave its people a glimpse at a different kind of future—until, at four o’clock in the morning on a Sunday in November, the citizens of Budapest awoke to the shattering sound of Russian tanks ravaging their streets. The revolution was over. But freedom beckoned in the form of a small footbridge at Andau, on the Austrian border. By an accident of history it became, for a few harrowing weeks, one of the most important crossings in the world, as the soul of a nation fled across its unsteady planks. Praise for The Bridge at Andau “Precise, vivid . . . immeasurably stirring.”—The Atlantic Monthly “Dramatic, chilling, enraging.”—San Francisco Chronicle “Superb.”—Kirkus Reviews “Highly recommended reading.”—Library Journal",['James A.

Most especially not to a sexy lawman who was dangerously close to discovering her secret. But whenever Zack came around, her beloved boy's eyes lit up—as did hers.

The Shenandoah Valley in 1864 (Campaigns of the Civil War),"Generally regarded as the most important of the Civil War campaigns conducted in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, that of 1864 lasted more than four months and claimed more than 25,000 casualties. The armies of Philip H. Sheridan and Jubal A. Early contended for immense stakes. Beyond the agricultural bounty and the boost in morale a victory would bring, events in the Valley also would affect Abraham Lincoln's chances for reelection in the November 1864 presidential canvass. The eleven original essays in this volume reexamine common assumptions about the campaign, its major figures, and its significance. Taking advantage of the most recent scholarship and a wide range of primary sources, contributors examine strategy and tactics, the performances of key commanders on each side, the campaign's political repercussions, and the experiences of civilians caught in the path of the armies. The authors do not always agree with one another, yet, taken together, their essays highlight important connections between the home front and the battlefield, as well as ways in which military affairs, civilian experiences, and politics played off one another during the campaign.

"I Believe in the Holy Spirit, Volume III: The River of Life Flows in the East and in the West","A key tenet of Christian faith is that the crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a unique death by which the powers of death in the world have been conquered, so that Christian life in the Spirit is marked by the promise and hope of 'new life' already anticipated in the community of baptized believers. Notwithstanding this basic tenet regarding the Christian life as a participation in the redemptive death of Jesus Christ, theology in the past, as well as much contemporary theology, tends to assign no salvific significance to the event of our own death, focusing instead on death in negative terms as the wages of sin. This work is a significant retort to theological neglect, both Catholic and Protestant, of the positive and transformative aspect of our death when conceived as a dying into the redemptive death of Jesus Christ. The development of Henry L. Novello's proposed theology of death takes place in conversation with the pre-eminent contemporary contributors to this field of theological inquiry. By offering comprehensive critiques of Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Karl Barth, Eberhard Jüngel and Jürgen Moltmann, Novello painstakingly pieces together a positive construal of death as salvific and transformative. What is especially distinctive about Novello's work is that he develops the idea of death as a sharing in the 'admirable exchange of natures' in the person of Jesus Christ, from which emerges his theory of resurrection at death for all. The reach of the work is extended by exploring some pastoral and liturgical implications of a theology of death conceived as the privileged moment for the actualization of God's grace in Jesus Christ, and thus being created anew in the power of the Spirit.",['Dr Henry L Novello'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8fmhAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=8fmhAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA234&dq=I+Believe+in+the+Holy+Spirit,+Volume+III:+The+River+of+Life+Flows+in+the+East+and+in+the+West&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2013-06-28,"http://books.google.com/books?id=8fmhAgAAQBAJ&dq=I+Believe+in+the+Holy+Spirit,+Volume+III:+The+River+of+Life+Flows+in+the+East+and+in+the+West&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Religion'],,book_covers/515_I_Believe_in_the_Holy_Spirit__Volume_III__The_River_of_Life_Flows_in_the_East_and_in_the_West.jpg,Religion,2

The pendulum & your health,"It is almost impossible to escape the Spanish Inquisition alive. However, Edgar Allan Poe’s unnamed narrator, after suffering innumerable tortures upon his body and soul in the hands of his tormenters, sees the light of the day at the very end of his sanity’s tether. Even despite the lack of supernatural elements, ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" (1842) has enjoyed and influenced several notable movie adaptations. Animations such as The ""Flinstones"", TV series like ""Crime Scene Investigation"", to films like Roger Corman’s ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" (1961), starring Vincent Price and some torture methods found in the ""Saw"" franchise, the story’s famous pendulum scene is a rather fruitful source of inspirations. Yet, despite the terrific torments, the story focuses primarily on how terror is implicitly depicted through the workings of the mind. Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was an American poet, author, and literary critic. Most famous for his poetry, short stories, and tales of the supernatural, mysterious, and macabre, he is also regarded as the inventor of the detective genre and a contributor to the emergence of science fiction, dark romanticism, and weird fiction. His most famous works include ""The Raven"" (1945), ""The Black Cat"" (1943), and ""The Gold-Bug"" (1843).",['Edgar Allan Poe'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-wTxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=-wTxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+pendulum&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Lindhardt og Ringhof,2020-08-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-wTxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],23.0,book_covers/67_The_pendulum___your_health.jpg,Fiction,0

The devil in the flesh,"The tragic and complicated French romance about a teenage boy who seduces the wife of a soldier during World War I—and one of the most startling literary debuts of all time A Penguin Classic As the First World War reaches its final year, an illicit love affair is beginning between a sixteen-year-old boy and a young woman who is married to a soldier at the front. They meet secretly in her flat on the outskirts of Paris, in cornfields and on river banks. When she receives letters from her husband, they burn them together. Intoxicated by passion, they cannot bear to end their affair, even when it causes a scandal among their friends and neighbours. Instead, they can only hurtle towards tragedy.

It's wrong that only those few have access to the impenetrable City, which he has always longed to enter.

But the more he learns of the grim truth about his people's deprivations, the less possible it seems that their world can be changed.

Straw Dogs (Blue Murder Series),"Olatundes lively imagination and wicked sense of humour maintain suspense and keep the plotline from tiring in this international, supernatural, semi-farcical thriller.

Ancient-Future Faith: Rethinking Evangelicalism for a Postmodern World,"In a world marked by relativism, individualism, pluralism, and the transition from a modern to a postmodern worldview, evangelical Christians must find ways to re-present the historic faith. In his provocative new work, Ancient-Future Faith, Robert E. Webber contends that present-day evangelicalism is a product of modernity. Allegiance to modernity, he argues, must be relinquished to free evangelicals to become more consistently historic. Empowerment to function in our changing culture will be found by adapting the classical tradition to our postmodern time. Webber demonstrates the implications in the key areas of church, worship, spirituality, evangelism, nurture, and mission. Webber writes, The fundamental concern of Ancient-Future Faith is to find points of contact between classical Christianity and postmodern thought. Classical Christianity was shaped in a pagan and relativistic society much like our own. Classical Christianity was not an accommodation to paganism but an alternative practice of life. Christians in a postmodern world will succeed, not by watering down the faith, but by being a counter cultural community that invites people to be shaped by the story of Israel and Jesus. A substantial appendix explores the development of authority in the early church, an important issue for evangelicals in a society that shares many features with the Roman world of early Christians. Students, professors, pastors, and laypeople concerned with the churchs effective response to a postmodern world will benefit from this paradigmatic volume. Informative tables and extensive bibliographies enhance the books educational value. - Amazon",,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5IGStGLC_6MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5IGStGLC_6MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Ancient-Future+Faith:+Rethinking+Evangelicalism+for+a+Postmodern+World&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Baker Academic,1999-11-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=5IGStGLC_6MC&dq=Ancient-Future+Faith:+Rethinking+Evangelicalism+for+a+Postmodern+World&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/532_Ancient-Future_Faith__Rethinking_Evangelicalism_for_a_Postmodern_World.jpg,Religion,2
"Blow Negative ! (""The Best Novel of the Navy Since the Caine Mutiny"")","James Webb’s classic, scorching novel of the Vietnam War. They each had their reasons for becoming a Marine. They each had their illusions. Goodrich came fresh from Harvard. Snake got the tattoo before he even got the uniform. Hodges was haunted by the spirits of family heroes. Three young men, from vastly different worlds, were plunged into a white-hot, murderous melting pot of jungle warfare in the An Hoa Basin, Vietnam, 1969. They had no way of knowing what awaited them. For nothing could have prepared them for the madness of what they found. And in the heat and horror of battle they took on new identities, took on each other, and were reborn in fields of fire...

"Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World","The gripping history of electricity and how the fateful collision of Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and George Westinghouse left the world utterly transformed. In the final decades of the nineteenth century, three brilliant and visionary titans of America’s Gilded Age—Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and George Westinghouse—battled bitterly as each vied to create a vast and powerful electrical empire. In Empires of Light, historian Jill Jonnes portrays this extraordinary trio and their riveting and ruthless world of cutting-edge science, invention, intrigue, money, death, and hard-eyed Wall Street millionaires. At the heart of the story are Thomas Alva Edison, the nation’s most famous and folksy inventor, creator of the incandescent light bulb and mastermind of the world’s first direct current electrical light networks; the Serbian wizard of invention Nikola Tesla, elegant, highly eccentric, a dreamer who revolutionized the generation and delivery of electricity; and the charismatic George Westinghouse, Pittsburgh inventor and tough corporate entrepreneur, an industrial idealist who in the era of gaslight imagined a world powered by cheap and plentiful electricity and worked heart and soul to create it. Edison struggled to introduce his radical new direct current (DC) technology into the hurly-burly of New York City as Tesla and Westinghouse challenged his dominance with their alternating current (AC), thus setting the stage for one of the eeriest feuds in American corporate history, the War of the Electric Currents. The battlegrounds: Wall Street, the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, Niagara Falls, and, finally, the death chamber—Jonnes takes us on the tense walk down a prison hallway and into the sunlit room where William Kemmler, convicted ax murderer, became the first man to die in the electric chair.",['Jill Jonnes'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BKX5UYWzVyQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=BKX5UYWzVyQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Empires+of+Light:+Edison,+Tesla,+Westinghouse,+and+the+Race+to+Electrify+the+World&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Random House Trade Paperbacks,2004-10-12,"http://books.google.com/books?id=BKX5UYWzVyQC&dq=Empires+of+Light:+Edison,+Tesla,+Westinghouse,+and+the+Race+to+Electrify+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],7.0,book_covers/805_Empires_of_Light__Edison__Tesla__Westinghouse__and_the_Race_to_Electrify_the_World.jpg,History,1

"Kingsport, Tennessee: A Planned American City","Kingsport, Tennessee, was the first thoroughly diversified, professionally planned, and privately financed city in twentieth-century America. The advent of this so-called model city, a glittering new industrial jewel in the green mountains, offered area residents an alternative to rural life and staid small-town existence as the new century dawned. Neither an Appalachian hamlet nor a company town, Kingsport developed as a self-proclaimed ""All-American City."" Produced by the marriage of New South philosophy and Progressivism, born of a passing historical moment when capitalists turned their attention to Southern Appalachia, and nurtured by the Protestant work ethic, Kingsport today reflects its heritage. From flaunting its patriotism with grandiose Fourth of July parades to being defensive about its pollution, the city exhibits values almost stereotypically those of middle-class America. But loss of vision and a decline in the quality of leadership plague contemporary Kingsport, and, like other American industrial strongholds, it is buffeted by the winds of the high-tech revolution and the changing world economy. This first full-length biography of Kingsport challenges interpretations of regional history that promote the colonial and poverty models. Margaret Ripley Wolfe brings to it the advantage of an insider's perspective. In considering the special roles of capital, labor, industry, and government over seven decades, she neither patronizes Appalachian workers nor treats developers and industrialists as villains. Her book will interest scholars of urbanization, city planning, landscape architecture, and industrialization, as well as local history enthusiasts.",['Margaret Ripley Wolfe'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G-QzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=G-QzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Kingsport,+Tennessee:+A+Planned+American+City&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",University Press of Kentucky,2021-12-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G-QzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/992_Kingsport__Tennessee__A_Planned_American_City.jpg,History,1

Palaeography for Family and Local Historians,"FAMILY AND LOCAL HISTORIANS frequently encounter the challenge posed by the writing, and sometimes the translation, of the records which might most enable them to make further progress with their research. Many pamphlets, booklets and even books have been produced over the past century to help with old handwriting and abbreviations, but this new work, written by an author who has for years run courses on the subject, is the most practical and comprehensive yet for family and local historians. There are examples, from the 1400s to the 1700s, of a wide range of hands found in the most usual categories of record used by family historians, such as parish registers, wills and court rolls, and in many others which disclose helpful information on families and localities. Those who use this book will not need to be persuaded of the great enjoyment to be derived from pursuing research into family or local history and the pleasures of piecing together evidence to throw new light on old times. They may also find great enjoyment in the deciphering of documents, the means to that end.

Fighters Over Russia (Luftwaffe At War),"The air war over the critical Eastern Front is illustrated with 120 specially selected and informatively captioned photographs in this striking new book. Initial success in Russia during the summer of 1941 gave way to desperate days after Stalingrad and the failure of Germany's last major offensive in 1943. Subsequently the Luftwaffe was stripped of its newest fighters for the defense of the Reich and lost air superiority to the Red Air Force. Unusual scenes include bombed-out Russian aircraft abandoned during the initial German advance and the use of horses and oxen to haul supplies and even aircraft, as fuel became scarce toward the end of the war. Several pictures of aircraft operated by the Germans' Rumanian allies add to the full insight given by this book into the air war in the East.",['Manfred Griehl'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dOqSGAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=dOqSGAAACAAJ&dq=Fighters+Over+Russia+(Luftwaffe+At+War)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Greenhill Books,1997-07-18,http://books.google.com/books?id=dOqSGAAACAAJ&dq=Fighters+Over+Russia+(Luftwaffe+At+War)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/826_Fighters_Over_Russia__Luftwaffe_At_War_.jpg,History,1

Appraising rare coins for Grandby & Sons, a venerable Madison Avenue auction house, is a dream come true for Mary Lou Bateson. She even gets a chance to inspect the Havistock Collection of priceless coins, which includes the Demaretion, a rare, ancient Greek silver piece. But when the Demaretion disappears just after her assessment, the young numismatist becomes the number-one suspect. Placed on indefinite leave, Bateson enlists the help of a New York Police Department cop and an insurance detective to go behind the closed doors of one of New York’s most powerful and untouchable families.

Sunlight At Midnight St. Petersburg And The Rise Of Modern Russia,"For Russians, St. Petersburg has embodied power, heroism, and fortitude. It has encompassed all the things that the Russians are and that they hope to become. Opulence and artistic brilliance blended with images of suffering on a monumental scale make up the historic persona of the late W. Bruce Lincoln's lavish ""biography"" of this mysterious, complex city. Climate and comfort were not what Tsar Peter the Great had in mind when, in the spring of 1703, he decided to build a new capital in the muddy marshes of the Neva River delta. Located 500 miles below the Arctic Circle, this area, with its foul weather, bad water, and sodden soil, was so unattractive that only a handful of Finnish fisherman had ever settled there. Bathed in sunlight at midnight in the summer, it brooded in darkness at noon in the winter, and its canals froze solid at least five months out of every year. Yet to the Tsar, the place he named Sankt Pieter Burkh had the makings of a ""paradise."" His vision was soon borne out: though St. Petersburg was closer to London, Paris, and Vienna than to Russia's far-off eastern lands, it quickly became the political, cultural, and economic center of an empire that stretched across more than a dozen time zones and over three continents. In this book, revolutionaries and laborers brush shoulders with tsars, and builders, soldiers, and statesmen share pride of place with poets. For only the entire historical experience of this magnificent and mysterious city can reveal the wealth of human and natural forces that shaped the modern history of it and the nation it represents.",['Bruce Lincoln'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jPMM7Abnk6EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jPMM7Abnk6EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sunlight+At+Midnight+St.+Petersburg+And+The+Rise+Of+Modern+Russia&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Basic Books,2009-04-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jPMM7Abnk6EC&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0,book_covers/725_Sunlight_At_Midnight_St__Petersburg_And_The_Rise_Of_Modern_Russia.jpg,History,1
"The glory of the cross,","The missionary among Moslems (to whom the Cross of CHRIST is a stumbling-block and the atonement foolishness) is driven daily to deeper meditation on this mystery of redemption and to a stronger conviction that here is the very heart of our message and our mission. The secret of the missionary passion. If the Cross of CHRIST is anything to the mind, it is surely everything -- the most profound reality and the sublimest mystery. One comes to realize that literally all the wealth and glory of the Gospel centres here. The Cross is the pivot as well as the centre of New Testament thought. It is the exclusive mark of the Christian faith, the symbol of Christianity and its cynosure. The more unbelievers deny its crucial character, the more do believers find in it the key to the mysteries of sin and suffering. We rediscover the apostolic emphasis on the Cross when we read the Gospel with Moslems. We find that although the offence of the Cross remains, its magnetic power is irresistible. The following chapters are the result of meditations on the passion of our Lord and His Death on the Cross in the midst of men who deny the historicity of the crucifixion and the necessity of the atonement. But the Moslem is not alone in his denial. The message of the Cross has always been an outrage and a scandal, a superfluity of foolishness to the worldly-wise. Yet it is CHRIST on the Cross who will finally draw all men to Himself. Under the shadow of the Cross is rest and peace. The glory of the Cross is as real as its shame; and to meditate on the shame is to see the glory. The Cross interprets sin and righteousness and love. It is the power of GOD and the wisdom of GOD. Its shadow is the longest shadow in the world, because it fell even on the Resurrection morning. ""He showed them His hands and His side."" Did He ever show them to you? Then were the disciples glad when they saw the scars of the Risen Lord. ""But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world"" (Galatians 6:14). Samuel Marinus Zwemer, [1867-1952] Samuel Zwemer was called to preach the Gospel to Muslims, and he is without doubt the greatest missionary to the Islamic world. On June 28, 1890, he began his mission, sailing from the United States on a Dutch liner the Obdam. Zwemer stopped in Europe to meet with other evangelical groups and then traveled to Beirut. Zwemer traveled throughout much of the Muslim world proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus including the Balkans, India, China, Africa, the Middle East.",['Samuel M.

Late Roman Cavalryman AD 236-565 (Warrior),"The twilight of the Roman Empire saw a revolution in the way war was waged.
