Rising Tide: The Untold Story of the Russian Submarines That Fought the Cold War,"For devotees of the submarine espionage stories in Blind Man's Bluff, Rising Tide tells the Soviet/Russian side of the most secretive operations of the Cold War. For the first time, seven Soviet admirals, along with leading naval historian Dr. Gary Weir, reveal the successful spying missions, the technological breakthroughs, the confrontations with U.S. forces, and the undersea disasters that killed many hundreds of sailors.With decades of experience on submarines or commanding submarine fleets, these seven senior admirals, many highly decorated, give us the inside stories. They detail the undersea successes such as the blockade of the U.S. submarine base in Bangor, Washington, and the innovative surveillance techniques they developed to trail the U.S. Sixth fleet in the Mediterranean. They reveal the development of the first nuclear submarines, profiling Dr. Peregudov, the father of the Soviet nuclear submarine and the internecine battles among Soviet bureaucrats that led to the deaths of many Russian sailors. And they give first hand accounts of deadly confrontations, such as the sinking of K-219, off Bermuda and the collision of USS Taurog and the Soviet K-108, including unpublished photos of the incident's aftermath. Rising Tide also reveals the many catastrophes and the occasional heroic rescues, and answers many questions surrounding the sensational loss of the Kursk, the most advanced vessel in the Russian fleet.Covering submarines from the first advanced diesel subs in the 1950s to the Kursk in 2000, with the authority only senior naval officials could deliver, Rising Tide is the complete story of the Soviet side of the gripping, secret life of the submariners in the Cold War.","['Gary E.

The High Graders,"The story was that Eli Patterson had died in a gunfight, but Mike Shevlin knew it couldn’t be true: the man who’d been like a father to him had been a Quaker. But when Shevlin rides back to Rafter Crossing to uncover the truth, he finds that the quiet ranching community has become a booming mining town. Newfound wealth has not made Rafter a peaceful place, however, and the smell of fear and greed is thick in the air. As Mike Shevlin tries to unravel the mystery of Patterson’s death, he is led deeper and deeper into a conspiracy that controls not only the fate of Rafter Crossing but the heart of a beautiful but tormented young woman—and Shevlin’s own destiny.","[""Louis L'Amour""]",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LI6fF7Crc4YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LI6fF7Crc4YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+High+Graders&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bantam,2003-12-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LI6fF7Crc4YC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3.0,book_covers/143_The_High_Graders.jpg,Fiction,0

Fighting in Hell: The German Ordeal on the Eastern Front,"The German war in Russia was so brutal in all its extremes that all past experiences paled beside it. Everything in Russia—the land, the climate, the distances and above all the people—were harder, harsher, more unforgiving and more deadly than anything the German soldier had ever faced before. One panzer-grenadier who fought in the West and in Russia summed it up: In the West war was the same honourable old game; nobody went out of his way to be vicious, and fighting stopped often by five in the afternoon. But in the East, the Russians were trying to kill you—all the time.The four detailed reports of campaigning in Russia included in this invaluable book (Russian Combat Methods in WWII, Effects of Climate on Combat in European Russia, Combat in Russian Forests and Swamps and Warfare in the Far North) were written in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as part of the US Army programme to record the German strategies and tactics of World War II directly from the commanders. The authors were all veterans of the fighting they described, and frankly admitted that the soldiers sent to Russia were neither trained nor equipped to withstand the full fury of the elements there. The German high command had been under the impression that the Red Army could be destroyed west of the Dnepr, and there would be no need for conducting operations in cold, snow and mud. Fighting in Hell shows what really happened, through first-hand accounts of the commanders who were there.",['Peter Tsouras'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DNTLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=DNTLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fighting+in+Hell:+The+German+Ordeal+on+the+Eastern+Front&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Casemate Publishers,2012-02-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DNTLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/796_Fighting_in_Hell__The_German_Ordeal_on_the_Eastern_Front.jpg,History,1

"Militant And Triumphant: William Henry O'Connell and the Catholic Church in Boston, 1859-1944","Militant and Triumphant fills a major gap in the historical record of American Catholicism by presenting a vivid, objective portrait of Cardinal William Henry O'Connell and his significance in the church and his times. Focusing on both the triumphs and controversies of O'Connell's career, James M. O'Toole chronicles the history of the Catholic Church in Boston in the first half of the twentieth century. The biography begins with a lively discussion of O'Connell's Irish immigrant youth and education and his early positions as rector of the American College in Rome and bishop of Portland, Maine. O'Toole convincingly demonstrates that as bishop, O'Connell actively built his own public image while ambitiously campaigning for the position of archbishop of Boston. The most enduring success, O'Toole argues, of O'Connell's 37-year tenure as archbishop of Boston--despite a sexual and financial scandal surrounding his nephew, the archdiocesan chancellor--was his elaboration of ""a personal style of leadership that was different from that of earlier bishops, changing the expectations for Catholic bishops in America by thrusting on them the role of public figures they have generally south to play since."" Throughout, the book examines O'Connell's cultural and symbolic leadership of New England's Catholic population, and describes O'Connell's role in defining American Catholicism as both ""militant and triumphant"" asserting its cultural vision beyond narrow denominational boundaries into broad areas of public morality, and confident of its eventual triumph over secular standards.","[""James M.

A Case of Conscience,"A space-traveling Jesuit priest confronts a moral but godless alien race in this Hugo Award–winning novel by the author of the Cities in Flight saga. Father Ruiz-Sanchez is a dedicated man, a Jesuit priest who is also a scientist, and a scientist who is also a human being. He doesn’t feel any genuine conflicts in his belief system—until he is sent to Lithia. The reptilian inhabitants of this distant world appear to be admirable in every way. Untroubled by greed or lust, they live in peace. But they have no concept of God, no literature, and no art. They rely purely on cold reason. But something darker lies beneath the surface: Do the Lithians pose a hidden threat? The answers that unfold could affect the fate of two worlds. Will Ruiz-Sanchez, a priest driven by his deeply human understanding of good and evil, do the right thing when confronted by a race that is alien to its core? The Science Fiction Encyclopedia lauds A Case of Conscience as “one of the first serious attempts to deal with religion [in science fiction], and [it] remains one of the most sophisticated. It is generally regarded as an SF classic.” Readers of Isaac Asimov’s Foundation Trilogy, Mary Doria Russell’s The Sparrow, or Walter M.

Go to the Ant,"About the Book King Solomon was a very wise man during his time because God gave him wisdom and exceedingly great understanding, and largeness of heart like the sand on the seashore (1Kings 4:29). He was further described according to verse 33 of 1 Kings 4 (TLB) as a great naturalist, with interest in animals, birds, snakes, fish and trees - from the great cedars of Lebanon down to the tiny hyssop which grows in cracks in the wall. Little wonder he was able to say with all confidence in Proverbs 6:6 that considering the ways of ants is capable of making one wise. He must have learnt certain doses of wisdom from them. With this wise man's recommendation in mind, I became inquisitive as to what lessons could be learnt from the ants. And fortunately for me, I was able to discover some of them which constitute the content of this book. I strongly believe that as you take your time to not only read these laws but also thoroughly digest them with readiness to apply them to your life, in no time you also will be referred to as wise.

Merely Life,"From Neil Abramson, USA Today bestselling author of Unsaid, comes a riveting novel that explores the complex connection between humans and animals. Veterinarian Samantha Lewis and her team are dedicated to providing a sanctuary for unwanted, abused, and abandoned dogs in New York City. But every day it gets harder to operate her no-kill shelter. Sam is already at her breaking point when she learns of an unidentified, dangerous virus spreading through their neighborhood. The medical community can only determine that animals are the carriers. Amid growing panic and a demand for immediate answers, suspicion abruptly falls on dogs as the source. Soon the governor is calling in the National Guard to enforce a quarantine--no dog may leave the area. Samantha knows from her own painful history that, despite the lack of real evidence against the dogs, a quarantine may only be the beginning. As questions about the source of the virus mount and clash with the pressure for a politically expedient resolution, Sam is forced to make life-altering choices. She finds allies in a motley crew of New Yorkers--a local priest, a troubled teen, a smart-mouthed former psychologist, and a cop desperate to do the right thing--all looking for sanctuary from their own personal demons. But the person Sam needs the most to unravel the mystery of the virus and save the dogs is the last one she'd ever want to call on--because contacting him will mean confronting the traumatic past she has fought so hard to escape.",['Neil Abramson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v6mDCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=v6mDCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Merely+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Center Street,2016-05-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v6mDCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],3.0,book_covers/109_Merely_Life.jpg,Fiction,0

God's Lesser Glory: The Diminished God of Open Theism,"Christians throughout history have been strengthened by their confidence that God knows everything about the future. But consider this: What if it simply is not true? What if God can only rely on His best guess about tomorrow—just as you and I do? Would it not affect your trust in Him, your confidence in facing the future, your worship, and your motivation to leave everything in His hands? And yet this is what a number of leading voices in evangelicalism are proposing under the doctrine of open theism. Open theism adjusts the entire picture of God's sovereignty and involvement in our lives. Bruce Ware carefully summarizes and critiques this dangerous doctrine from a thoroughly biblical perspective, exploring their implications and faithfully pinpointing the subtle ways that open theism undermines our trust in God and lessens His glory in our lives.",['Bruce A.

Stewardess,"The empowering true story of a group of spirited stewardesses who “stood up to huge corporations and won, creating momentous change for all working women.” (Gloria Steinem, co-founder of Ms. magazine) It was the Golden Age of Travel, and everyone wanted in. As flying boomed in the 1960s, women from across the United States applied for jobs as stewardesses. They were drawn to the promise of glamorous jet-setting, the chance to see the world, and an alternative to traditional occupations like homemaking, nursing, and teaching. But as the number of “stews” grew, so did their suspicion that the job was not as picture-perfect as the ads would have them believe. “Sky girls” had to adhere to strict weight limits at all times; gain a few extra pounds and they’d be suspended from work. They couldn’t marry or have children; their makeup, hair, and teeth had to be just so. Girdles were mandatory while stewardesses were on the clock. And, most important, stewardesses had to resign at 32. Eventually the stewardesses began to push back and it’s thanks to their trailblazing efforts in part that working women have gotten closer to workplace equality today. Nell McShane Wulfhart crafts a rousing narrative of female empowerment, the paradigm-shifting ’60s and ’70s, the labor movement, and the cadre of gutsy women who fought for their rights—and won.",['Nell McShane Wulfhart'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GSs5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=GSs5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Stewardess&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Doubleday,2022-04-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GSs5EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],2.0,book_covers/840_Stewardess.jpg,History,1
White mother,"Into the lives of two ragged little Negro girls came an angel—a white angel. So it seemed to Veanie and Mingie Bennett, seven-year-old twins in a Florida town, half-savage, motherless, caring for their paralyzed and dying father. Alone they fought for their lives, stole food, and struggled against a hostile world. Then chance led them to the white side of town and the door of Mrs. Rossie Lee. It proved to be the door to a new life. “It was not at first intended to be an autobiography, but I found that I could do it no other way and still reveal and convey my full purpose—to write the story of a most gracious lady—a Southern white lady—to whom my sister and I attribute all that is sweet in our lives. I discovered that my sister and I were so intricately woven into the background, setting, and the story itself that we had to fulfill our inherent parts in this beautiful memory.

Suleiman the Magnificent,"Suleiman the Magnificent, most glorious of the Ottoman sultans, kept Europe atremble for nearly half a century. In a few years he led his army as far as the gates of Vienna, made himself master of the Mediterranean and established his court in Baghdad. Faced with this redoubtable champion, who regarded it as his duty to extend the boundaries of Islam farther and farther, the Christian world struggled to unite against him. 'The Shadow of God on Earth', but also an expert politician and all-powerful despot, Suleiman ruled the state firmly with the help of his viziers. He extended the borders of the empire beyond what any of the Ottoman sultans had achieved, yet it is primarily as a lawgiver that he is remembered in Turkish history. His empire held dominion over three continents populated by more than thirty million inhabitants, among whom nearly all of the races and religions of mankind were represented. Prospering under a well-directed, authoritarian economy, Suleiman's reign marked the apogee of Ottoman power. City and country alike experienced unprecedented economic and demographic growth. Istanbul was the largest city in the world, enjoying a remarkable renaissance of arts and letters; a mighty capital, it was the seat of the Seraglio and dark intrigue.

The Cross Legged Knight (Owen Archer Mysteries 08),"York, 1371. The Bishop of Winchester, William of Wykeham, is tasked with bringing home the remains of the powerful patriarch of the Pagnell family. But Wykeham’s arrival is fraught with tension. The Pagnells are reeling from their father’s death and they suspect Wykeham of having a hand in it. Days after his arrival, his townhouse burns to the ground—a terrible accident, or a threat. When the charred body of a woman is found in the remains, Wykeham fears for his reputation and his life. The Archbishop of York, John Thoresby, turns to the one-eyed spy, Owen Archer, for help. Archer, preoccupied by his wife’s tragic miscarriage, reluctantly agrees to investigate the case.

LEES LIEUTENANTS,"A towering landmark in Civil War literature, long considered one of the great masterpieces of military history -- now available in a one-volume abridgment. Lee's Lieutenants: A Study in Command is the most colorful and popular of Douglas Southall Freeman's works. A sweeping narrative that presents a multiple biography against the flame-shot background of the American Civil War, it is the story of the great figures of the Army of Northern Virginia who fought under Robert E. Lee. Dr. Freeman describes the early rise and fall of General Beauregard, the developing friction between Jefferson Davis and Joseph E. Johnston, the emergence and failure of a number of military charlatans, and the triumphs of unlikely men at crucial times. He also describes the rise of the legendary ""Stonewall"" Jackson and traces his progress in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign and into Richmond amid the acclaim of the South. The Confederacy won resounding victories throughout the war, but seldom easily or without tremendous casualties. Death was always on the heels of fame, but the men who survived -- among them Jackson, Longstreet, and Ewell -- developed as commanders and men. Lee's Lieutenants follows these men to the costly battle at Gettysburg, through the deepening twilight of the South's declining military might, and finally to the collapse of Lee's command and his formal surrender in 1865. To his unparalleled descriptions of men and operations, Dr. Freeman adds an insightful analysis of the lessons learned and their bearing upon the future military development of the nation. Accessible at last in a one-volume edition abridged by noted Civil War historian Stephen W. Sears, Lee's Lieutenants is essential reading for all Civil War buffs, students of war, and admirers of the historian's art as practiced at its very highest level.",['Douglas Southall Freeman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WUdf79en8tMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=WUdf79en8tMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=LEES+LIEUTENANTS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2010-06-15,http://books.google.com/books?id=WUdf79en8tMC&dq=LEES+LIEUTENANTS&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],2.0,book_covers/843_LEES_LIEUTENANTS.jpg,History,1

The Good Wine: Reading John from the Center,"The Good Wine is an exciting and challenging overview of the gospel of John. Bruno Barnhart has created a mystical roadmap of the biblical book, which is often considered the most difficult and theological of the four gospels. Following the lead of Peter Ellis, Barnhart has organized the whole of John's gospel around a single truth: that God poured divine reality into humankind through the person of Jesus Christ. This belief stands at the center of the gospel, and every episode in the narrative refracts the light of that core affirmation. The gospel, when interpreted this way, assumes a mandalic pattern in which all parts are related to the center and through it to each other. The mandalic pattern is also a gate of entry for believers who seek to relate their own destinies to the Source of Life. This book differs from other treatments of John's gospel in that its method is sapiential, following the wisdom-tradition of the church fathers. It explores the symbolic significance of the gospel and pays attention to chiastic textures which establish patterned, repetitive relationships between narrative episodes. The result is a deeply spiritual work that explodes with flashes of illumination for persons who come to the gospel jaded with traditional scholarship.",['Bruno Barnhart'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z_JLAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=z_JLAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Good+Wine:+Reading+John+from+the+Center&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2008-12-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z_JLAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,book_covers/528_The_Good_Wine__Reading_John_from_the_Center.jpg,Religion,2

Provence: From minstrels to the machine,"""Provence"" may perhaps be described as the crystallisation of the main idea running through the Great Trade Route, which we published a year ago. Of that book Mr A.G. McDonnell wrote in the Observer: ""It is an Indictment, a Philipic....I know of no books to compare with this since Winwood Reade's Martyrdom of Man"" But if ""The Great Trade Route"" was the destructive onslaught on dubious aspects of contemporary civilisation, ""Provence"" is the celebration of what might have been and what, according to Mr. Ford, may still yet be - contrasted with what is. For in that triangle of sun-baked , wind-swept, austere yet generous land, bounded as to its base by the Mediterranean and as to its sides, by the Rhone and the Alps, Mr Ford sees all the pride of past European splendour, the small healthy core of Europe's ailing present, the only promise for her future.

"Modern Spain, 1875-1980 (Opus)","The word 'liberal', as part of our political vocabulary comes from Spain. It was first used to describe a group of radical patriots cooped up in Cadiz, refugees from the French invasion of 1808. In 1812 they drew up a constitution enshrining the sovereignty of the people which struck the very basis of the old monarchy and became the model for advanced democrats from St Petersburg to Naples. Universal male suffrage was established in Spain in 1890 - earlier than Britain. The imposition ofadvanced liberal institutions on a conservative society, both economically and socially backward, inevitably caused tensions, and these, Raymond Carr argues, explain much of modern Spanish history. His analysis, incorporating much new research, starts at the 'September Revolution' of 1868 and goes right up to the present day. In the 1970s and 80s the country suffered less from the violent social disruption experienced in previous decades, but - as always - Spain is beset with acute regional problems which become more pressing the longer they remain unsolved.",['Raymond Carr'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ckgyP_k0xjAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=ckgyP_k0xjAC&pg=PA188&dq=Modern+Spain,+1875-1980+(Opus)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Oxford Paperbacks,1980,"http://books.google.com/books?id=ckgyP_k0xjAC&dq=Modern+Spain,+1875-1980+(Opus)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],,book_covers/925_Modern_Spain__1875-1980__Opus_.jpg,History,1

Confessions of a Fallen Standard-Bearer,"A moving, two-generational tale of two families from the acclaimed author of the New York Times Notable Book, Dreams of My Russian Summers. They are virtual brothers, Arkady and Alyosha, young pioneers in Stalin’s postwar world, marching to the clarion call of socialism, to the stirring beat of the drums. The future, they are assured, is bright and beautiful. But what, then, are those endless miles of barbed wire they encounter everywhere along their route? The fathers of the two young pioneers, Yakov Zinger and Pyotr Yevdokimov, are inseparable, having been through the grueling war against the Germans, with all its horror and senseless carnage. Yakov—or Yasha, as he was known—emerged physically intact but scarred forever “from the moment when he had been lifted out of a mountain of frozen bodies at a camp in liberated Poland.” Pyotr, a skilled sniper who operated behind the German lines, lost both his legs, not at the hands of the Germans, but as a result of an artillery “mistake” by his own forces. Together, in these post–Cold War years, the two families try to piece together their shattered lives. “Brilliant . . . Exquisitely wrought.” —The New York Times",['Andreï Makine'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UBR1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UBR1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Confessions+of+a+Fallen+Standard-Bearer&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Skyhorse + ORM,2011-10-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UBR1EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0,book_covers/197_Confessions_of_a_Fallen_Standard-Bearer.jpg,Fiction,0
Great American Air Battles of World War II,"A history of World War II’s Operation Argument in which US and British air forces led a series of raids against Nazi Germany in 1944. During the third week of February 1944, the combined Allied air forces based in Britain and Italy launched their first round-the-clock bomber offensive against Germany. Their goal: to smash the main factories and production centers of the Luftwaffe while also drawing German planes into an aerial battle of attrition to neutralize the Luftwaffe as a fighting force prior to the cross-channel invasion, planned for a few months later. Officially called Operation Argument, this aerial offensive quickly became known as “Big Week,” and it was one of the turning-point engagements of World War II. In Big Week, acclaimed World War II historian James Holland chronicles the massive air battle through the experiences of those who lived and died during it. Prior to Big Week, the air forces on both sides were in crisis. Allied raids into Germany were being decimated, but German resources—fuel and pilots—were strained to the breaking point. Ultimately new Allied aircraft—especially the American long-range P-51 Mustang—and superior tactics won out during Big Week. Through interviews, oral histories, diaries, and official records, Holland follows the fortunes of pilots, crew, and civilians on both sides, taking readers from command headquarters to fighter cockpits to anti-aircraft positions and civilian chaos on the ground, vividly recreating the campaign as it was conceived and unfolded. In the end, the six days of intense air battles largely cleared the skies of enemy aircraft when the invasion took place on June 6, 1944—D-Day. Big Week is both an original contribution to WWII literature and a brilliant piece of narrative history, recapturing a largely forgotten campaign that was one of the most critically important periods of the entire war. Praise for Big Week An Amazon Best Book of the Year “With the aid of diaries, memoirs and his own interviews, Mr. Holland gives a detailed, crewman’s-eye view of combat from inside the British, American and German aircraft during the months leading up to Big Week and during the week itself. For those hoping for war-movie stuff, rest assured that the enemy fighters do come in at 6 o’clock, the guns do hammer, the sun does glint and the ‘chutes do blossom in the sky. Still it’s a serious and important story as well as a dramatic one, and Mr. Holland tells it with verve and authority.” —David A. Price, Wall Street Journal “Highly detailed. . . . The interplay of personal stories with the broader strategic picture makes this book especially illuminating. . . . A fascinating must-read for World War II aficionados.” —Kirkus Reviews (starred review)",['James Holland'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6lpgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=6lpgDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Great+American+Air+Battles+of+World+War+II&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Atlantic Monthly Press,2018-11-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6lpgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0,book_covers/863_Great_American_Air_Battles_of_World_War_II.jpg,History,1
The LITTLE SISTER: RAYMOND CHANDLER'S PHILIP MARLOWE (ILLUSTRATED),"The American author of detective fiction, Raymond Chandler created the private detective Philip Marlowe, characterised as a poor, yet honest upholder of ideals in an opportunistic and brutal world.

Scottish Exodus: Travels Among a Worldwide Clan,"Millions of Scots have left their homeland during the last 400 years. Until now, they have been written about in general terms. Scottish Exodus breaks new ground by taking particular emigrants, drawn from the once-powerful Clan MacLeod, and discovering what happened to them and their families. These people became, among other things, French aristocrats, Polish resistance fighters, Texan ranchers, New Zealand shepherds, Australian goldminers, Aboriginal and African-American activists, Canadian mounted policemen and Confederate rebels. One nineteenth-century MacLeod even went so far as to swap his Gaelic for Arabic and his Christianity for Islam before settling down comfortably in Cairo. This gripping account of Scotland's worldwide diaspora is based on unpublished documents, letters and family histories. It is also based on the author's travels in the company of today's MacLeods - some of them still in Scotland, others further afield. Scottish Exodus is a tale of disastrous voyages, famine and dispossession, the hazards of pioneering on faraway frontiers. But it is also the moving story of how people separated from Scotland by hundreds of years and thousands of miles continue to identify with the small country where their journeyings began.",['James Hunter'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NpgpmFCbT40C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NpgpmFCbT40C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Scottish+Exodus:+Travels+Among+a+Worldwide+Clan&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2011-03-25,http://books.google.com/books?id=NpgpmFCbT40C&dq=Scottish+Exodus:+Travels+Among+a+Worldwide+Clan&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/948_Scottish_Exodus__Travels_Among_a_Worldwide_Clan.jpg,History,1

Blonde,"« Alors, en début de soirée, ce 3 août 1962, vint la Mort, index sur la sonnette du 12305 Fifth Helena Drive. La Mort qui essuyait la sueur de son front avec sa casquette de base-ball. La Mort qui mastiquait vite, impatiente, un chewing-gum. Pas un bruit à l'intérieur. La Mort ne peut pas le laisser sur le pas de la porte, ce foutu paquet, il lui faut une signature. Elle n'entend que les vibrations ronronnantes de l'air conditionné. Ou bien... est-ce qu'elle entend une radio là ? La maison est de type espagnol, c'est une « hacienda » de plain-pied; murs en fausses briques, toiture en tuiles orange luisantes, fenètres aux stores tirés. On la croirait presque recouverte d'une poussière grise. Compacte et miniature comme une maison de poupée, rien de grandiose pour Brentwood. La Mort sonna à deux reprises, appuya fort la seconde. Cette fois, on ouvrit la porte. De la main de la Mort, j'acceptais ce cadeau. Je savais ce que c'était, je crois. Et de la part de qui c'était. En voyant le nom et l'adresse, j'ai ri et j'ai signé sans hésiter. »",['Joyce Carol Oates'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9CtvHAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9CtvHAAACAAJ&dq=Blonde&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,LGF/Le Livre de Poche,2002,http://books.google.com/books?id=9CtvHAAACAAJ&dq=Blonde&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/221_Blonde.jpg,Fiction,0

Out of this world: Across the Himalayas to forbidden Tibet,"In 1949, renowned travel writer Lowell Thomas, Jr., along with his father, the American writer and broadcaster best known as the man who made Lawrence of Arabia famous, was invited by the Tibetan government to make a film there, in the hope that their reports would help persuade the U.S. government to defend Tibet against the Chinese. The trip lasted 400 days, and the father-and-son team were the last Westerners to reach Lhasa before the Chinese invasion and occupation. The trek garnered worldwide attention when Lowell Thomas, Jr. succeeded in getting his father safely across the Himalayas to India after a serious accident on a 17,000-foot pass.

African Successes: Four Public Managers of Kenyan Rural Development,"For the past twenty-five years Kenya has progressed while much of Africa has stagnated. Instead of the economic disasters, underdevelopment, and serious food shortages that have plagued its neighbors, Kenya has enjoyed an expanding economy and agriculture. And instead of a corrupt and incompetent public administration, Kenya has established several successful rural development programs run by public servants with integrity and professional commitment. What accounts for these Kenyan successes? In this innovative study, David Leonard illustrates the way public policy is made and implemented in Kenya by focusing on four public officials who have had a great impact on rural development. He skillfully weaves his analyses of Kenya's political, economic, and administrative systems into evocative biographical portraits of Charles Karanja, General Manager of the Kenya Tea Development Authority, Harris Mule, administrative head of Finance and Planning, Ishmael Muriithi, head of the Veterinary Department, and Simeon Nyachae, Cabinet Secretary and chief of the Civil Service. The result is a fascinating glimpse of Kenyan political life from the inside, set in the context of the historical and social forces that have shaped that country's government.",['David K.

Memoirs of a woman of pleasure,"John Cleland’s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure has been described as the first erotic novel in English and is perhaps the greatest example of the genre. From the outset it was mired in disrepute. Cleland penned the novel to liberate himself from debtors’ prison, and the book’s manifestly lewd content led to its legal suppression within a year of publication. Though versions of the novel, nearly always abridged in some form, continued to find a way into print, the Memoirs remained an underground text until the 1960s. Only as that decade ushered in a culture less socially deferential and more sexually permissive was the moment opportune for the obscenity ban to be successfully challenged. Cleland’s novel is a triumph of literary style, resting on his invention of an entirely new, vividly metaphoric, terminology for describing sexual pleasure. This Broadview Edition provides extensive materials on Cleland’s biography and career, contemporary censorship, and pornography and prostitution in the eighteenth century.",['John Cleland'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NmFCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=NmFCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Memoirs+of+a+woman+of+pleasure&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Broadview Press,2018-03-30,http://books.google.nl/books?id=NmFCDwAAQBAJ&dq=Memoirs+of+a+woman+of+pleasure&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/21_Memoirs_of_a_woman_of_pleasure.jpg,Fiction,0

The Shah and the Ayatollah: Iranian Mythology and Islamic Revolution,"Twenty-two years after Ayatollah Khomeini's ascent to power in Iran many aspects of his 1979 Islamic revolution remain obscure if not baffling. For instance, in November 1978 an offer was made to him in his Paris exile to return to Iran with international guarantees of freedom of speech and action. He refused and demanded the departure of the Shah. Americans put pressure on the monarch to leave the country. Khomeini arrived in Tehran in early February 1979, and he immediately demanded the return of the Shah and his trial before an Islamic tribunal! No one could give a valid explanation of this contradiction in Khomeini's conduct and demands. Many other mysteries in the unfolding of the revolution and the policies of the Islamic republic which replaced the monarchy have gone unexplained up to now. Scholars and experts in the West have offered the usual explanations for the Islamic revolution-corruption, deepening gaps between the rich and the poor, rapid industrialization, sky-rocketing inflation, westernizing policies that offended traditions, lack of democratic institutions, authoritarian rule, and on and on. But such characteristics which exist in other Muslim countries, especially in the Arab world, fail to clairify the particularities of the Iranian revolution. Indeed, as Ambassador Hoveyda points out, Iran is not an Arab country. It has kept alive its ancient mythological heritage which is not Islamic. It is an Indo-European nation with a recorded history of three thousand years! To understand the real causes of the 1979 revolution one must refer to the deep-rooted beliefs of Iranians and to their very rich mythology. One must also take into account the kind of Islam-shiism-Iranians have created and nurtured. In fact, Iran is a powerful example of how mythologies remain alive and can account for the conduct of a whole nation. Hoveyda shows the influence of myths in history-in-the-making. Indeed, he has found in the Iranian revolution many points that can be clarified only by the impact of old mythology and mindsets. He provides a very original explanation of the events that led to the fall of the Shah and the ascent of Khomeini, changing the political and diplomatic situation in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and the Caspian Sea region. As such it will be of great interest to scholars, students, researchers, and foreign policy makers involved with the Middle East and Islamic fundamentalism.",['Fereydoun Hoveyda'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QbMgb9pHKIkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QbMgb9pHKIkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Shah+and+the+Ayatollah:+Iranian+Mythology+and+Islamic+Revolution&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,ABC-CLIO,2003-02-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QbMgb9pHKIkC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/719_The_Shah_and_the_Ayatollah__Iranian_Mythology_and_Islamic_Revolution.jpg,History,1

"The Venture of Islam, Volume 2: The Expansion of Islam in the Middle Periods","The Venture of Islam has been honored as a magisterial work of the mind since its publication in early 1975. In this three-volume study, illustrated with charts and maps, Hodgson traces and interprets the historical development of Islamic civilization from before the birth of Muhammad to the middle of the twentieth century. This work grew out of the famous course on Islamic civilization that Hodgson created and taught for many years at the University of Chicago. In the second work of this three-volume set, Hodgson investigates the establishment of an international Islamic civilization through about 1500. This includes a theoretical discussion of cultural patterning in the Islamic world and the Occident. ""This is a nonpareil work, not only because of its command of its subject but also because it demonstrates how, ideally, history should be written.""—The New Yorker",['Marshall G. S.

Hannibal,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “Is it as good as Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs? No . . . this one is better.”—Stephen King, The New York Times Book Review You remember Hannibal Lecter: gentleman, genius, cannibal. Seven years have passed since Dr. Lecter escaped from custody. And for seven years he’s been at large, free to savor the scents, the essences, of an unguarded world. But intruders have entered Dr. Lecter’s world, piercing his new identity, sensing the evil that surrounds him. For the multimillionaire Hannibal left maimed, for a corrupt Italian policeman, and for FBI agent Clarice Starling, who once stood before Lecter and who has never been the same, the final hunt for Hannibal Lecter has begun. All of them, in their separate ways, want to find Dr. Lecter. And all three will get their wish. But only one will live long enough to savor the reward. . . . Praise for Hannibal “Interested in getting the hell scared out of you? Buy this book on a Friday . . . lock all doors and windows. And by Monday , you might just be able to sleep without a night-light.”—Newsday “Strap yourself in for one heck of a ride. . . . It’ll scare your socks off.”—Denver Post “A stunner . . . writing in language as bright and precise as a surgeon’s scalpel, Harris has created a world as mysterious as Hannibal’s memory palace and as disturbing as a Goya painting. This is one book you don’t want to read alone at night.”—The Atlanta Journal-Constitution “Relentless . . . endlessly terrifying . . . 486 fast-paced pages, in which every respite is but a prelude to further furious action . . .

Ethics for the New Millennium,"Don't miss His Holiness the Dalai Lama's classic book, The Art of Happiness, or his newest, The Book of Joy, named one of Oprah's Favorite Things. In a difficult, uncertain time, it takes a person of great courage, such as the Dalai Lama, to give us hope. Regardless of the violence and cynicism we see on television and read about in the news, there is an argument to be made for basic human goodness. The number of people who spend their lives engaged in violence and dishonesty is tiny compared to the vast majority who would wish others only well. According to the Dalai Lama, our survival has depended and will continue to depend on our basic goodness. Ethics for the New Millennium presents a moral system based on universal rather than religious principles. Its ultimate goal is happiness for every individual, irrespective of religious beliefs. Though he himself a practicing Buddhist, the Dalai Lama's teachings and the moral compass that guides him can lead each and every one of us—Muslim, Christian, Jew, Buddhist, or atheist—to a happier, more fulfilling life.",['Dalai Lama'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KxCijLLN9D0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KxCijLLN9D0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Ethics+for+the+New+Millennium&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2001-05-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KxCijLLN9D0C&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],7.0,book_covers/624_Ethics_for_the_New_Millennium.jpg,Religion,2

Truth Aflame: Theology for the Church in Renewal,"“Larry Hart’s Truth Aflame brings together charismatic renewal and classic evangelical faith better than anything I have read. An important contribution to the contemporary renaissance in systematic theology!” Timothy George Dean of Beeson Divinity School of Samford University, Executive Editor of Christianity Today As the Pentecostal/charismatic movement continues to grow, so does the need for solid theological resources for its members. While there are many volumes of systematic theology available, very few are written from a distinctly charismatic perspective. Truth Aflame seeks to meet that need. While academically sound, Truth Aflame is written with a practical, pastoral flavor. Larry Hart defines systematic theology as the process of taking what the Bible teaches and relating it to contemporary questions and knowledge. His passion for the subject is evident: he is concerned that the reader both grasps the magnificence of the study of God and allows these great truths to be transformative. This Truth, then—liberating, enlivening, and transforming Truth—becomes central to the ongoing renewal of the church that we are seeing in our day. Dr. Hart treats each of the traditional categories—revelation, God, creation, humanity, sin, Christ, salvation, the church, and last things—from a Pentecostal/charismatic perspective. He addresses other theological viewpoints but does not get bogged down in analysis and rebuttal. Further, he seeks to build bridges of understanding to those evangelicals outside the charismatic tradition. Clear, succinct, and readable, this revised and updated edition of Truth Aflame is well-suited not only for students, but for anyone desiring a greater understanding of Pentecostal/charismatic theology.",['Larry D.

Dressed to Rule : Royal and Court Costume from Louis XIV to Elizabeth II,"Throughout history rulers have used clothes as a form of legitimization and propaganda. While palaces, pictures, and jewels might reflect the choice of a monarch’s predecessors or advisers, clothes reflected the preferences of the monarch himself. Being both personal and visible, the right costume at the right time could transform and define a monarch’s reputation. Many royal leaders have known this, from Louis XIV to Catherine the Great and from Napoleon I to Princess Diana. This intriguing book explores how rulers have sought to control their image through their appearance. Mansel shows how individual styles of dress throw light on the personalities of particular monarchs, on their court system, and on their ambitions. The book looks also at the economics of the costume industry, at patronage, at the etiquette involved in mourning dress, and at the act of dressing itself. Fascinating glimpses into the lives of European monarchs and contemporary potentates reveal the intimate connection between power and the way it is packaged.",['Philip Mansel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QCIxgIZ4w38C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QCIxgIZ4w38C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dressed+to+Rule+:+Royal+and+Court+Costume+from+Louis+XIV+to+Elizabeth+II&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Yale University Press,2005-01-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=QCIxgIZ4w38C&dq=Dressed+to+Rule+:+Royal+and+Court+Costume+from+Louis+XIV+to+Elizabeth+II&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/728_Dressed_to_Rule___Royal_and_Court_Costume_from_Louis_XIV_to_Elizabeth_II.jpg,History,1

Dwarf's blood,"A contemporary of Cecil Beaton, Siegfried Sassoon and Rex Whistler, Edith Olivier is best known for her first book, the novella, The Love Child but was the author of a variety of both fiction and non-fiction, as well as becoming the mayor of Wilton, Wiltshire, in 1939. In Dwarf's Blood, Olivier has crafted a moral tale, reflecting the Victorian values of her upbringing while also incorporating a psychological study of her main character, Sir Nicholas Roxerby, who comes to England from Australia after inheriting the estate of Brokeyates from his great-uncle. Happy in his ancestral home, with the backing of his mother's millions behind him, Nicholas marries into the local gentry and lives a satisfying life until the birth of his second child. Hans is full of persuasive charm and gifted genius, but to Nicholas's horror carries the 'dwarf's blood' of the title, and he cannot find it within himself to accept a child that brings with him the reminder of a family skeleton he would rather forget. In Nicholas's eyes, Hans suffers in comparison to his elder sister Portia, who is tall, healthy and beautiful, despite being completely insensitive, overbearing and unloveable; and for Althea, his wife, the cold-hearted rejection of her son by his father ruptures her happiness. Though a vivid work of realism, Dwarf's Blood incorporates a touch of the eeriness found within Olivier's first work, The Love Child, and was described as a masterpiece among contemporary novels upon first publication in 1931.",['Edith Olivier'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XtQ8BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=XtQ8BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dwarf%27s+blood&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pan Macmillan,2014-08-28,http://books.google.com/books?id=XtQ8BAAAQBAJ&dq=Dwarf%27s+blood&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0,book_covers/286_Dwarf_s_blood.jpg,Fiction,0

Farmers in Rebellion: The Rise and Fall of the Southern Farmers Alliance and People's Party in Texas,"The years after the Civil War brought struggle to the Southern farmer as the economic mainstay of the South—cotton—steadily dropped in price. Prompted by hard times, farmers in Lampasas County, Texas, gathered in 1877 to discuss what could be done. From these modest origins emerged the National Farmers Alliance and Industrial Union, later known as the Southern Farmers Alliance, a powerful protest movement that played an important role in the formation in 1892 of a new political force, the People's party. In the ""solid South,"" particularly in Texas, large numbers of voters abandoned the Democratic party for the new party. Yet despite this support, the decline of the People's party after 1894 was swift. Farmers in Rebellion recounts the compelling story of these two crucial and closely related movements. Donna A. Barnes examines their developmental histories, asking such important questions as: Under what conditions do protest movements remain weak? Under what conditions do they prosper, amassing large numbers of supporters? And under what conditions do successful protest movements lose their momentum and die? The author explores these complex questions with deft use of archival data that allows her to reflect on the adequacy of the past sociological answers to these questions. Farmers in Rebellion is a book rich in detail and scope in its look at a critical juncture in the growth of national populist movements. Of interest to sociologists, historians, and political scientists, it stands as an important contribution to our understanding of a pivotal time in Texas, and national, history.",['Donna A.

Reporting World War II Part Two: American Journalism 1944-46,"Concerns about rights in the United States have a long history, but the articulation of global human rights in the twentieth century was something altogether different. Global human rights offered individuals unprecedented guarantees beyond the nation for the protection of political, economic, social and cultural freedoms. The World Reimagined explores how these revolutionary developments first became believable to Americans in the 1940s and the 1970s through everyday vernaculars as they emerged in political and legal thought, photography, film, novels, memoirs and soundscapes. Together, they offered fundamentally novel ways for Americans to understand what it means to feel free, culminating in today's ubiquitous moral language of human rights. Set against a sweeping transnational canvas, the book presents a new history of how Americans thought and acted in the twentieth-century world.",['Mark Philip Bradley'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6zn7DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6zn7DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA258&dq=Reporting+World+War+II+Part+Two:+American+Journalism+1944-46&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2016-09-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6zn7DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/762_Reporting_World_War_II_Part_Two__American_Journalism_1944-46.jpg,History,1
Memoirs of an infantry officer,"The second volume in Siegfried Sassoon’s beloved trilogy, The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston, with a new introduction by celebrated historian Paul Fussell A highly decorated English soldier and an acclaimed poet and novelist, Siegfried Sassoon won fame for his trilogy of fictionalized autobiographies that wonderfully capture the vanishing idylls of Edwardian England and the brutal realities of war. The second volume of Siegfried Sassoon's semiautobiographical George Sherston trilogy picks up shortly after Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man: in 1916, with the young Sherston deep in the trenches of WWI. For his decorated bravery, and also his harmful recklessness, he is soon sent to the Fourth Army School for officer training, then dispatched to Morlancourt, a raid, and on through the Somme. After being wounded by a bullet through the lung, he returns home to convalesce, where his questioning of the war and the British Military establishment leads him to write a public anti-war letter (verbatim the letter Sassoon wrote in 1917, entitled ""Finished with the War: A Soldier’s Declaration"", which was eventually read in the British House of Commons). Through the help of close friend David Cromlech (based on Sassoon's friend Robert Graves) a medical board decides not to prosecute, but instead deem him to be mentally ill, suffering from shell-shock, and sends him to a hospital for treatment. Sassoon's stunning portrayal of a mind coming to terms with the brutal truths he has encountered in war—as well as his unsentimental, though often poetic, portrayal of class-defined life in England at wartime—is amongst the greatest books ever written about World War I, or war itself.

Black Church Beginnings: The Long-Hidden Realities of the First Years,"Black Church Beginnings provides an intimate look at the struggles of African Americans to establish spiritual communities in the harsh world of slavery in the American colonies. Written by one of today's foremost experts on African American religion, this book traces the growth of the black church from its start in the mid-1700s to the end of the nineteenth century.As Henry Mitchell shows, the first African American churches didn't just organize; they labored hard, long, and sacrificially to form a meaningful, independent faith. Mitchell insightfully takes readers inside this process of development. He candidly examines the challenge of finding adequately trained pastors for new local congregations, confrontations resulting from internal class structure in big city churches, and obstacles posed by emerging denominationalism.Original in its subject matter and singular in its analysis, Mitchell's Black Church Beginnings makes a major contribution to the study of American church history.",['Henry H.

Darwin's Theory of Evolution appears to do away with God, but there is enormous controversy among Darwin scientists as to how evolution works. Other scientists raise critical objections. Darwinism is not proven. Scientists don't know how life got started, because living matter, even single-celled forms, have been found to be extremely complex.

Deceptions and Myths of The Bible,"An eye-opening, myth-busting tour of the Old and New Testaments, the true origins of their stories, and the faith that’s required to believe them. The Bible is accepted across the globe as the holy word of God. But today we know that it’s made up of fanciful legends set down by power-seeking priests eager to inspire awe and fear in their flocks. And as Deceptions and Myths of the Bible illustrates, these tales of scriptural tyranny aren’t even original—but rather retold and revised mythologies. The story of Adam and Eve was derived from a Babylonian account. Noah’s dilemma is the exaggerated accumulation of over four hundred years of flood accounts from various ancient civilizations. Even the names of Noah’s sons are hand-me-downs, as was the tale of Isaac’s sacrifice, Solomon’s judgment, and Samson’s pillar act. Moses? Fashioned from the Syrian story of Mises. As for the laws of the Bible, they were patterned after the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi. Revealed here, too, are the 137 similarities between the story of Jesus and the story of the Egyptian god Horus, and nearly twice as many parallels between the story of Christ and the Hindu god Krishna, and many more faith-shaking revelations. For any reader interested in theology, this is an essential read. For atheists, it’s an irrefutable argument of support; for agnostics, evidence to tip the scale. For the devout, it offers an enlightening, history-based awareness of the derivation of your religion.",['Lloyd M.

The Rebirth of the Habsburg Army: Friedrich Beck and the Rise of the General Staff (Contributions in Military Studies),"Friedrich Beck was the single most important figure in the transformation of the inept Habsburg military into the modern military state that would wage World War I. He correctly perceived that only an elite body of officers responsible for war planning and preparation could provide lasting security for the Austro-Hungarian empire. After firmly establishing the general staff as an institution, Beck led war planning to counter threats from Russia, Italy, and the Balkans; and spearheaded a vast rebuilding of the rail network. While his rise to power marked a return to the favorite system of military administration of the early Franz Joseph period, Beck proved himself a man with real military ability that revolutionized an army.",['Scott Lackey'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sY9Pn3urkQ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=sY9Pn3urkQ4C&pg=PR2&dq=The+Rebirth+of+the+Habsburg+Army:+Friedrich+Beck+and+the+Rise+of+the+General+Staff+(Contributions+in+Military+Studies)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,ABC-CLIO,1995-10-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sY9Pn3urkQ4C&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/858_The_Rebirth_of_the_Habsburg_Army__Friedrich_Beck_and_the_Rise_of_the_General_Staff__Contributions_in_Military_Studies_.jpg,History,1

The Gnostics,"Gnostics have always sought to “know” rather than to accept dogma and doctrine, often to their peril. This inquiry into Gnosticism examines the character, history, and beliefs of a brave and vigorous spiritual quest that originated in the ancient Near East and continues into the present day.Lawrence Durrell writes, “This is a strange and original essay, more a work of literature than of scholarship, though its documentation is impeccable. It is as convincing a reconstruction of the way the Gnostics lived and thought as D.H. Lawrence’s intuitive recreation of the vanished Etruscans.”",['Jacques Lacarriere'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yQxMBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=yQxMBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Gnostics&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Peter Owen Publishers,2014-08-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yQxMBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],1.0,book_covers/499_The_Gnostics.jpg,Religion,2

Pilgrim : A Novel,"Ageless. Sexless. Deathless. Timeless. Pilgrim is a man who cannot die, an astounding character in a novel of the cataclysmic contest between creation and destruction. Pilgrim is Timothy Findley’s masterwork, a finalist for the Giller Prize, and a national bestseller that has smashed the author’s own impressive sales records. It is 1912 and Pilgrim has been admitted to the Burghölzli Psychiatric Clinic in Zürich, Switzerland, having failed—once again—to commit suicide. Over the next two years, it is up to Carl Jung, self-professed mystical scientist of the mind, to help Pilgrim unlock his unconsciousness, etched as it is with myriad sufferings and hopes of history. Is Pilgrim mad, or is he condemned to live forever, witness to the terrible tragedy and beauty of the human condition? Both intimate and expansive in its scope, with an absorbing parade of characters—mythic, fictional and historical—Pilgrim is a fiercely original and powerful story from one of our most distinguished artists.",['Timothy Findley'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xKmDFRVwWEUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xKmDFRVwWEUC&pg=PP1&dq=Pilgrim+:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperCollins Canada,2010-06-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=xKmDFRVwWEUC&dq=Pilgrim+:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],11.0,book_covers/4_Pilgrim___A_Novel.jpg,Fiction,0

Atlas of North American Railroads,"America's long romance with the train has been the subject of many books, but none has used contemporary maps to comprehensively illustrate the story. Until now. Here the latest of Derek Hayes's historical atlases delves into the history of the railroad in North America, from its origins in Britain in the 1820s and short lines connecting Eastern Seaboard rivers in the 1830s to Amtrak and the modern intermodal freights driving today's railroad revival. Colorful and informative, the book covers a vast range of topics and offers an impressive array of types of railroad map, from the purely utilitarian to the gorgeously promotional. Nearly 400 old railroad maps, most in full color, plus many historical photos, brochures, and posters, combine to provide a new perspective on the North American railroad. Historical Atlas of the North American Railroad also explains how the railroad transformed the economic and social life of a continent, fundamentally changing the two North American nations it linked from the Atlantic to the Pacific.",['Derek Hayes'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Rz7p0aMKiNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Rz7p0aMKiNoC&q=Atlas+of+North+American+Railroads&dq=Atlas+of+North+American+Railroads&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2010,http://books.google.com/books?id=Rz7p0aMKiNoC&dq=Atlas+of+North+American+Railroads&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/890_Atlas_of_North_American_Railroads.jpg,History,1
