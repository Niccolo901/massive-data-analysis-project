3 Contemporary Brazilian Plays,"Drama. Latino/Latina Studies. Translated from the Portuguese by various. The 2nd Edition of THREE CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN PLAYS reintroduces three of Brazil's most dynamic and gifted playwrights to the English-speaking audience. Plinio Marcos' Two Lost in the Filthy Night shows language as the only possession of two paupers living in claustrophobic conditions. The rapid and vigorous dialogue lashes out, enclosing the reader in a brutal game. Leilah Assumpcao, in Moist Lips, Quiet Passion, dramatizes the sexual life of a couple trying to achieve their Big Orgasm. They remember their frustrating games by the dates of the military coups. Existence is possible only through games. In Walking Papers by Consuleo de Castro, a man and a woman interact in fragmented situations bordering on insanity. There is no reference to socio-political events, but the obsessive language and the exacerbating rituals of the claustrophobic relationship projects the shadow of the repressive system.","['Elzbieta Szoka', 'Joe W.

Blood and Honor,"As did his three immensely popular series Brotherhood of War, The Corps and Badge of Honor, W.E.B. Griffin's novel of World War II espionage Honor Bound became an immediate bestseller: ""A superior war story"" (Library Journal) ""whose twists and turns keep readers guessing until the last page"" (Publishers Weekly). Now the characters of Honor Bound are back, in an adventure as exciting as anything Griffin has written. It is April 1943, and Marine aviator Cletus Frade, Army demolition's wizard Anthony Pelosi, and communications expert David Ettinger are thrust again into the lethal nest of intrigue that is wartime Buenos Aires.

In the midst of it all, the German-ordered assassination of Cletus Frade's father demands only one response: revenge. Threading their way carefully between Axis and Allied sympathizers, and even between rival OSS and FBI factions, the three solidiers must strive their utmost not only to fulfill their missions--but just to stay alive.

Mad Power,"Journalist Rebecca Traister’s New York Times bestselling exploration of the transformative power of female anger and its ability to transcend into a political movement is “a hopeful, maddening compendium of righteous feminine anger, and the good it can do when wielded efficiently—and collectively” (Vanity Fair). Long before Pantsuit Nation, before the Women’s March, and before the #MeToo movement, women’s anger was not only politically catalytic—but politically problematic. The story of female fury and its cultural significance demonstrates its crucial role in women’s slow rise to political power in America, as well as the ways that anger is received when it comes from women as opposed to when it comes from men. “Urgent, enlightened…realistic and compelling…Traister eloquently highlights the challenge of blaming not just forces and systems, but individuals” (The Washington Post). In Good and Mad, Traister tracks the history of female anger as political fuel—from suffragettes marching on the White House to office workers vacating their buildings after Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Traister explores women’s anger at both men and other women; anger between ideological allies and foes; the varied ways anger is received based on who’s expressing it; and the way women’s collective fury has become transformative political fuel. She deconstructs society’s (and the media’s) condemnation of female emotion (especially rage) and the impact of their resulting repercussions. Highlighting a double standard perpetuated against women by all sexes, and its disastrous, stultifying effect, Good and Mad is “perfectly timed and inspiring” (People, Book of the Week). This “admirably rousing narrative” (The Atlantic) offers a glimpse into the galvanizing force of women’s collective anger, which, when harnessed, can change history.",['Rebecca Traister'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JZ2nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=JZ2nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mad+Power&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon & Schuster,2019-09-03,http://books.google.com/books?id=JZ2nDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mad+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],9.0,book_covers/959_Mad_Power.jpg,History,1

"Black night, white snow: Russia's Revolutions 1905-1917","The destruction of the Czars which brought about the reign of revolutions from 1905–1917 in Russia looms as the crucial political event of the twentieth century. In little more than a decade the Romanov dynasty was toppled, and its time-honored institutions repudiated. How did it happen? How could Nicholas and Alexandra, the nobility, middle class anarchists—even Lenin himself—not foresee the catastrophic changes that were shaking the empire? Why could nothing be done? And why were the efforts so ineffectual? Black Night, White Snow captures the rich drama of this whole period. With the artistry of a Balzac, Harrison Salisbury exposes the strata of Russian society, with its decedents, prophetic poets, religious fanatics, and newly liberated serfs. From archival sources within the Soviet Union, interviews, and his personal photography collection, he recreates the story as it happened. Hard data on Russia's economy, a first-hand knowledge of the county, and a historian's gift of compression are combined in a fast-paced narrative that reads with the ease of a good novel and the urgency of a newspaper headline.",['Harison E.

Jews Without Judaism: Conversations With an Unconventional Rabbi,"...a step in the right direction... -Humanist in Canada. . .easy-to-read . . .[Friedman] succeeds in clearly and persuasively presenting the attitudes of Jewish humanism. --Publishers Weekly...a valuable step toward understanding the humanistic perspective.--ChoiceIt may fairly be said that religion plays virtually no part in the lives of most American Jews. So begins Daniel Friedman's provocative discussion of American Judaism. Friedman, a rabbi for almost forty years, has counseled thousands of Jews on the meaning of being Jewish. From this wealth of experience he has created this fascinating series of fictional conversations, each of them a distillation of many actual conversations.Should Jews marry outside the faith, and if so, what are the likely consequences? How should Jews cope with anti-Semitism, or evaluate their tense historical relationship with Christianity? Can one be Jewish without being religious; without belief in God; indeed, without Judaism? Are all values relative if one does not believe in God?In contemporary society these timely questions are of great importance to both practicing and nonpracticing Jews. Each of the fictional conversations thoroughly explores these issues with sensitivity and offers much valuable advice culled from Rabbi Friedman's many years of thinking about what it means to be Jewish in a secular age.Daniel Friedman (Lincolnshire, IL) has served since 1965 as the rabbi of Congregation Beth Or, a humanistic temple in Deerfield, IL. One of the founders of the Society for Humanistic Judaism, he serves on the editorial board and is a regular contributor to the journal Humanistic Judaism.",['Daniel Friedman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LTHCjRHv1aYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LTHCjRHv1aYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jews+Without+Judaism:+Conversations+With+an+Unconventional+Rabbi&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Prometheus Books,,http://books.google.com/books?id=LTHCjRHv1aYC&dq=Jews+Without+Judaism:+Conversations+With+an+Unconventional+Rabbi&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/794_Jews_Without_Judaism__Conversations_With_an_Unconventional_Rabbi.jpg,History,1

Something about the place immortalized in Stephen Leacock’s classic Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town has always inspired its people to reach for their dreams.

BLACK MAY : The Epic Story of the Allies defeat of the German U-Boats in May 1943,"In May 1943, Allied sea and air forces won a stunning, dramatic, and vital victory over the largest and most powerful submarine force ever sent to sea, sinking forty-one German U-boats and damaging thirty-seven others. It was the forty-fifth month of World War II, and by the end of May the Germans were forced to acknowledge defeat and recall almost all of their remaining U-boats from the major traffic lanes of the North Atlantic. At U-Boat Headquarters in Berlin, despondent naval officers spoke of ""Black May."" It was a defeat from which the German U-boat fleet never recovered. Black May is a triumph of scholarship and narrative, an important work of history, and a great sea story. Acclaimed historian Michael Gannon, author of Operation Drumbeat, has done enormous research and produced the most thoroughly documented study ever done of these battles. In his compelling historical saga, the people are as significant as the technical information. Given the strategic importance of the events of May 1943, it is natural to ask, How did Black May happen and why? Who or what was responsible? Were new Allied tactics adopted or new weapons employed? This book answers those questions and many others. Drawing on original documents in German, British, U.S., and Canadian archives, as well as interviews with surviving participants, Gannon describes the exciting sea and air battles, frequently taking the reader inside the U-boats themselves, aboard British warships, onto the decks of torpedoed merchant ships, and into the cockpits of British and U.S. aircraft. Throughout, Gannon tells the Black May story from both the German and Allied perspectives, often using the actual words of captains and crews. Finally, he allows the reader to ""listen in"" on secretly recorded conversations of captured U-boat men in POW quarters during that same incredible month, giving intimate and moving access to the thoughts and emotions of seamen that is unparalleled in naval literature. Rarely, if ever, has the U-boat war been presented so accurately, so graphically, and so personally as in Black May.",['Michael Gannon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DB16C1plLBsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=DB16C1plLBsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=BLACK+MAY+:+The+Epic+Story+of+the+Allies+defeat+of+the+German+U-Boats+in+May+1943&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2011-08-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DB16C1plLBsC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/787_BLACK_MAY___The_Epic_Story_of_the_Allies_defeat_of_the_German_U-Boats_in_May_1943.jpg,History,1

The haunting of Hill House,"The greatest haunted house story ever written, the inspiration for a 10-part Netflix series directed by Mike Flanagan and starring Michiel Huisman, Carla Gugino, and Timothy Hutton First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a “haunting”; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers—and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.

Intrepid Coitions,"Reid tells one of the greatest sea stories in the history of the U.S. Navy. Under Commodore Edward Preble, the Navy came of age fighting the scourge of the time, the infamous Barbary Pirates. Intrepid Sailors chronicles the Navy’s campaign to subdue the pirate leader of Tripoli, who declared war on the United States in 1801. After two failed campaigns, Preble took command of the U.S. squadron in the Mediterranean and served notice to world the U.S. Navy would be a force with which to reckon. Among the ships in Preble’s flotilla was a non-descript little ketch. Once a French supply boat, the ketch served Tripoli until the U.S. squadron captured her in 1803. Upon her capture, Preble incorporated the little boat into his force, re-naming her the Intrepid. She was the first ship in the United States Navy to bear the name of Intrepid and would play a central role in some of the primary feats of “Preble’s Boys.” The exploits of the officers and sailors in this campaign are the stuff of legend. In culling myth from fact, Reid went back to original sources, using the words of the men in the campaign to tell their story. Whether it is Decatur leading the daring raid to burn the captured frigate Philadelphia or the escape attempts of American prisoners in Tripoli, Intrepid Sailors brings to life a story many Americans once widely knew but that today has become little more than footnote. Unlike other books on the topic, however, Intrepid Sailors delves into the development of officers and sailors under Preble. Most were half the age of their commander and few had major combat experience. Under Preble, these men forged a legacy of professionalism to which the Navy still adheres. The book also examines one of the most famous friendships in American and Navy history – that of Decatur and Somers. Their thirst for glory and utter devotion to making the U.S. Navy a permanent, respected force inspired all around them but that quest for immortality never caused a breach in their friendship. Instead, that friendship grew stronger, providing even more inspiration. Intrepid Sailors offers a rare insight into the lives of men who today loom larger-than-life and who continue to inspire each new class of naval officer. Stephen Decatur, Richard Somers, Charles Stewart, James Lawrence, Edward Preble and a pantheon of early U.S. Navy heroes all come to life.",['Chipp Reid'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DfzFh1VNtugC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=DfzFh1VNtugC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Intrepid+Coitions&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Naval Institute Press,2012-10-15,http://books.google.com/books?id=DfzFh1VNtugC&dq=Intrepid+Coitions&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/855_Intrepid_Coitions.jpg,History,1
"The Lectionary Commentary, the Third Readings: Theological Exegesis for Sunday's Texts; The Gospels","Preaching pastors, ministers, and priests know how quickly Sundays come and go. ""The Lectionary Commentary"" will not slow the pace of the weekly calendar, but it will help assure that sermon preparation begins with a solid engagement with Scripture. Designed to ""jump start"" the difficult task of sermon preparation, this indispensable three-volume work gathers exegetical essays on biblical texts from the Revised Common Lectionary. Covering every Sunday of the three-year liturgical cycle, as well as Christmas Day, Epiphany, and Ascension Day, the readings are arranged in canonical order so as to be of use to all preachers. Seventy-eight pastors, priests, and teachers from a variety of Christian traditions have contributed their insights to ""The Lectionary Commentary."" Designed to answer the question ""What does the preacher need to know about this text in order to preach a faithful sermon from it?,"" each of their essays closely considers its specific biblical text, all the while remaining alert to the contemporary context in which the sermon will be spoken and heard. The result is an invaluable resource that will aid in the difficult task of facilitating a meaningful encounter between Holy Scripture and our modern world. This volume, ""The Third Readings: The Gospels,"" provides exegetical commentary on the lectionary readings for the witnesses to Jesus Christ written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Also unique to this volume is an excellent essay by C. Clifton Black on Augustinian preaching and the nurture of Christians. Consulting Editors: Richard A. Burridge Thomas W. Gillespie Colin E.

Dead March,"Winner of the Bolton-Johnson Prize Winner of the Utley Prize Winner of the Distinguished Book Award, Society for Military History “The Dead March incorporates the work of Mexican historians...in a story that involves far more than military strategy, diplomatic maneuvering, and American political intrigue...Studded with arresting insights and convincing observations.” —James Oakes, New York Review of Books “Superb...A remarkable achievement, by far the best general account of the war now available. It is critical, insightful, and rooted in a wealth of archival sources; it brings far more of the Mexican experience than any other work...and it clearly demonstrates the social and cultural dynamics that shaped Mexican and American politics and military force.” —Journal of American History It has long been held that the United States emerged victorious from the Mexican–American War because its democratic system was more stable and its citizens more loyal. But this award-winning history shows that Americans dramatically underestimated the strength of Mexican patriotism and failed to see how bitterly Mexicans resented their claims to national and racial superiority. Their fierce resistance surprised US leaders, who had expected a quick victory with few casualties. By focusing on how ordinary soldiers and civilians in both countries understood and experienced the conflict, The Dead March offers a clearer picture of the brief, bloody war that redrew the map of North America.",['Peter Guardino'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jsIyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=jsIyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dead+March&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harvard University Press,2017-08-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jsIyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0,book_covers/773_Dead_March.jpg,History,1

Decolonial Voices: Chicana and Chicano Cultural Studies in the 21st Century,"The interdisciplinary essays in Decolonial Voices discuss racialized, subaltern, feminist, and diasporic identities and the aesthetic politics of hybrid and mestiza/o cultural productions. This collection represents several key directions in the field: First, it charts how subaltern cultural productions of the US/ Mexico borderlands speak to the intersections of ""local,"" ""hemispheric,"" and ""globalized"" power relations of the border imaginary. Second, it recovers the Mexican women's and Chicana literary and cultural heritages that have been ignored by Euro-American canons and patriarchal exclusionary practices. It also expands the field in postnationalist directions by creating an interethnic, comparative, and transnational dialogue between Chicana and Chicano, African American, Mexican feminist, and U.S. Native American cultural vocabularies.

Why the North won the Civil War (Collier Books),"Focusing on the political, military, economic, social, and diplomatic reasons behind the Union victory, this collection presents the most complete picture of this key aspect of Civil War studies. In an essay new to this edition, Henry Steele Commager offers a historiographical overview of the collapse of the Confederacy. Richard N. Current describes the economic superiority of the North and shows how the civilian resources of the South were dissipated during the war. T.

Everything known about the facts of William Shakespeare’s life seems incompatible with the extraordinary genius of his writing. How could a man who left school at the age of 13, and apparently never travelled abroad have authored the incomparable Sonnets or so intricately described Renaissance Venice? Shakespeare ‘candidates’ abound, among them Sir Francis Bacon, The Earl of Oxford, even Queen Elizabeth I herself, but none have stood up to serious scrutiny. Until now....

The Confident Hope of a Miracle: The True History of the Spanish Armada,"The real story of the Spanish Armada. In the winter of 1587 the Spanish Armada, the largest force of warships ever assembled, set sail to crush the English navy. This breathtaking overview of one of the most fascinating campaigns in European history begins with the execution of Mary Queen of Scots, the event that precipitated the launching of the Armada. From the first whispers of the threat against England and the English crown, to the return of the battered remnants of the fleet to Spain eighteen months later, it is a story rich in incident and intrigue. In this controversial study, Neil Hanson claims that Francis Drake’s intention was not to sink the Armada ships but to disable and plunder them. He further claims that Queen Elizabeth was a monarch who left many of the survivors of the battle to die of disease or starvation and whose parsimony, prevarication and cynicism left her unable to make crucial decisions. Drawing on previously undiscovered personal papers, Neil Hanson conveys in vivid detail how the highest and the lowest in the land fared in those turbulent months when the destiny of all Europe hung in the balance.

In Search of God the Mother: The Cult of Anatolian Cybele,"This book examines one of the most intriguing figures in the religious life of the ancient Mediterranean world, the Phrygian Mother Goddess, known to the Greeks and Romans as Cybele or Magna Mater, the Great Mother. Her cult was particularly prominent in central Anatolia (modern Turkey), and spread from there through the Greek and Roman world. She was an enormously popular figure, attracting devotion from common people and potentates alike. This book is the first comprehensive assembly and discussion of the entire extant evidence concerning the worship of the Phrygian Mother Goddess, from her earliest appearance in the prehistoric record to the early centuries of the Roman Empire. Lynn E. Roller presents and analyzes literary, historiographic, and archaeological data with equal acuity and flair. While previous studies have tended to emphasize the more outrageous aspects of the Mother Goddess's cult, such as her orgiastic rituals and the eunuch priests who attended her, this book places a special focus on Cybele's position in Anatolia and the ways in which the identity of the goddess changed as her cult was transmitted to Greece and Rome. Roller gives a detailed account of the growth, spread, and evolution of her cult, her ceremonies, and her meaning for her adherents. This book will introduce students of Classical antiquity to many aspects of the Great Mother which have been previously unexamined, and will interest anyone who has ever been piqued by curiosity about the Mother Goddess of the ancient Western world.",['Lynn E.

Sex and Celibacy,"The traditional Catholic Church views true celibacy as a gift from God. But today's reality paints a much different picture. In ""Sex, Celibacy, and Priesthood, "" the Most Rev. Lou A. Bordisso reviews the research on sexual activity and celibacy among Catholic priests. Featuring heart-wrenching, anonymous, and candid self-disclosures about the sexual behaviors of heterosexual, gay, and bisexual priests, Bordisso explores the meaning of celibacy in accordance with Roman Catholic Church teachings, doctrine, and canon law. ""Sex, Celibacy, and Priesthood"" provides an honest and frank study of current perspectives on celibacy in light of priestly sexual behaviors. It allows for Roman Catholic priests to speak out in their own voices about their struggles and the conflicts they experience between celibacy and their sexual activities. At a time when most are disgusted with the sexual scandal cover-ups, smokescreens, and veil of secrecy provided by many Roman Catholic bishops and their apologists, ""Sex, Celibacy, and Priesthood"" tells the truth and encourages us to think imaginatively and compassionately about an issue of crucial importance to the Roman Catholic Church at this moment in history.",['Lou A.

This view, still held by many today, is challenged by Stuart Reid, who paints a picture of an increasingly professional force. This was an important time of change and improvement for the British Army, and British Redcoat 1740-1793 fully brings this out in its comprehensive examination of the lives, conditions and experiences of the late 18th-century infantryman.",['Stuart Reid'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=roXvCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=roXvCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=British+Redcoat+1740-93+(Warrior)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2012-04-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=roXvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/683_British_Redcoat_1740-93__Warrior_.jpg,History,1

"The complete Stalky & Co.,","Kipling portrays school as the first stage of a much larger game, a pattern-maker for the experiences of life. Implied throughout the stories is the question 'What happened to these fifteen-year-old boys, and how did the lessons they learned at school apply to the world of warfare and imperial government?' The stories are based on Kipling's own school, the United Services College at Westward Ho! in Devon, which prepared boys destined for the army or for colonial service; Kipling himself appears as the subordinate character, Beetle. This edition includes five Stalky stories which did not appear in the original volume, and thus constitutes a Complete Stalky & Co.

The angry wife,"A novel of a Southern woman trapped in the past and two brothers divided by the Civil War, from the New York Times–bestselling author of The Good Earth. Lucinda Delaney is a southern belle ruled by a vision of life that no longer exists. The Civil War has come and gone and her side has lost, yet she is determined to proceed as if nothing has changed—a denial that stokes the flames of her irrational angers. Despite her returned husband’s devotion, Lucinda is sure he is having an affair with one of their slaves. After all, his Union-sympathizing brother, Tom, did just that, scandalously running away with the woman and settling into contented family life in Philadelphia. Over the years, her racist feelings and fears only intensify, and when it’s time for her own daughter to marry, her chief concern is the color of the children. The Angry Wife is a memorable and impassioned dissection of prejudice, as well as a riveting portrait of post­–Civil War America. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Pearl S.

Sunderlies Seeking: Ghatten's Gambit #1 (Ghatti's Tale),"The Sunerlies—home to convicts, rebels, and the unwanted refuse of society—or so it has traditional been. Even now it is a land where, for the law-abiding population, the price of safety is eternal vigilance. For Doyce’s and Jenret’s sixteen-year-old twins, Jenneth and her brother Diccon, the very name is a summons to exotic adventure. So when Jenret proposes taking them—and any friends who wish to make the journey—along on a business trip to the Sunerlies, the twins can hardly contain their excitement. The only thing more thrilling is the newfound bond Jenneth has made with the ghatten Pw’eek and Diccon with her sister ghatten Kwee. Yet almost from the start the journey seems overshadowed with bad luck—or evil intent. Though Doyce, newly retired from the position of Seeker General, has come along in the hopes of restrengthening her emotional ties with her husband Jenret, they seem to be caught in a kind of private war neither can control. And before the party even sets sail, “accidents” begin to occur. First Doyce is thrown by her mount. Next a campfire explosion menaces Jenneth, Diccon, and the other children. Yet despite these ill omens, they are determined not to turn back. But the real disaster strikes at sea, when a storm sweeps Jenneth and Pw’eek overboard. Desperate to find his lost twin, Diccon has no way of knowing what the worst of all of them still lies ahead—in the Sunerlies, where a once-vanquished and long-vanished enemy waits—a fanatic determined to eradicate Resonates and Seekers alike…",['Gayle Greeno'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tORHVmYUFeUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=tORHVmYUFeUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sunderlies+Seeking:+Ghatten%27s+Gambit&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,1998-11-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tORHVmYUFeUC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],,book_covers/125_Sunderlies_Seeking__Ghatten_s_Gambit__1__Ghatti_s_Tale_.jpg,Fiction,0

But when verifying information about Federal Judge Brenda Thompson, it becomes clear that she’s lying about a 3-week gap in her past that occurred between college and law school. Her old roommate could provide answers, but she’s missing. Soon, Monk has a dead body on his hands, and he and Special Agent Lisa Sands are plunged into a maelstrom of deceit, corruption, and murder that reaches the highest levels of government.

America Reborn: A Twentieth-Century Narrative in Twenty-six Lives,"Here is the story of America in the twentieth century as told through the lives of twenty-six of its most remarkable and historically crucial men and women. The people Martin Walker has chosen to portray are presidents, industrialists, artists, thinkers, entertainers, soldiers, spies, criminals, and evangelists, among others, and he makes the life of each individual serve as a framework for a discussion of the nation as a whole in a century when it was reinventing itself. Through Theodore Roosevelt, Walker examines America's ambition; through Woodrow Wilson, our idealism; through FDR, our triumph on the world stage; through Richard Nixon, our retreat into cynicism; through Bill Clinton, globalization and controversy about the right way to use America's unprecedented power. In Henry Ford he finds the creator of both the mass-market product and the mass-market consumer, and in Walt Disney, the revolutionizer not only of America's entertainment but also of the world's. William Boeing is the innovator who spurs the behemoth of American aviation; Walter Reuther defines labor's struggles; George C. Marshall represents the spread of America's economic genius in a war-ravaged Europe. In the lives of Duke Ellington, Frank Lloyd Wright, Katharine Hepburn, and John Steinbeck, Walker traces America's far-reaching cultural influences. Babe Ruth leads to a consideration of the role of sports in our society; William F. Buckley, Jr., to a discussion of conservatism; Martin Luther King, Jr., to matters of race; Betty Friedan to the shifting role of women; Billy Graham to an examination of religion; Emma Goldman to minority viewpoints and dissent; Black Jack Pershing to the place of the military; Lucky Luciano to crime and corruption; Albert Einstein to immigration; Richard Bissell to spies and the intelligence network; Alan Greenspan to finance and banking; and Winston Churchill to the American diaspora. At once intimate and wide-ranging, America Reborn is an altogether engrossing work of narrative history.",['Martin Walker'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0XMD4cgtTJgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0XMD4cgtTJgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=America+Reborn:+A+Twentieth-Century+Narrative+in+Twenty-six+Lives&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2011-03-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0XMD4cgtTJgC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/814_America_Reborn__A_Twentieth-Century_Narrative_in_Twenty-six_Lives.jpg,History,1

Sent ahead to secure her merchant caravan a place in the next village, Sedra took a shortcut through the familiar ruins she used to play in as a child -- but found a magical attack waiting for her instead of memories.

The Travelers, who have dedicated their lives to roaming the world and helping those in need, are Sedra’s only hope of finding out who attacked her and why. They may be her people’s only hope in the dark days yet to come.

"Tales of the End: A Narrative Commentary on the Book of Revelation (The Storytellers Bible, V. 1)","The book of Revelation perennially provokes outlandish futurist predictions proven patently false over time. Such prophecy failures leave the inquiring mind with a strong sense that the book of Revelation is nothing but a hoax, safely ignored and without contemporary relevance. The inevitable practical result, not only for church members, but for their ministers as well, is a canonical book stripped bare of canonical authority. In this volume, six contributors collectively attempt to provide a path toward recanonizing Revelation, reclaiming its authority and relevance through christological foundations. The result is a book not only useful in the collegiate and seminary classroom, but also for serious small-group Bible studies wanting to glean from Revelation something deeper than a fear of being ""left behind.""",['Gerald L.

Tet!: The Turning Point in the Vietnam War,"Finalist for the 1971 National Book Award In early 1968, Communist forces in Vietnam launched a surprise offensive that targeted nearly every city, town, and major military base throughout South Vietnam. For several hours, the U.S. embassy in Saigon itself came under siege by Viet Cong soldiers. Militarily, the offensive was a failure, as the North Vietnamese Army and its guerrilla allies in the south suffered devastating losses. Politically, however, it proved to be a crucial turning point in America's involvement in Southeast Asia and public opinion of the war. In this classic work of military history and war reportage—long considered the definitive history of Tet and its aftermath—Don Oberdorfer moves back and forth between the war and the home front to document the lasting importance of this military action. Based on his own observations as a correspondent for the Washington Post and interviews with hundreds of people who were caught up in the struggle, Tet! remains an essential contribution to our understanding of the Vietnam War.",['Don Oberdorfer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r6lQ-430NL0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=r6lQ-430NL0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tet!:+The+Turning+Point+in+the+Vietnam+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,JHU Press,2001-03-31,http://books.google.com/books?id=r6lQ-430NL0C&dq=Tet!:+The+Turning+Point+in+the+Vietnam+War&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/795_Tet___The_Turning_Point_in_the_Vietnam_War.jpg,History,1
The temple of gold,"The New York Times–bestselling author’s phenomenal debut novel about growing up in midwestern, midcentury America. Raymond Euripides Trevitt grows up virtually alone in the small town of Athens, Illinois, until a new boy moves in next door. His name is Zachary Crowe, but he goes by Zock. They’re as different as two midwestern boys can be, but their friendship will go on to shape—if not define—both of their lives. In the early days, Ray takes Zock hiking and Zock teaches Ray about poetry. They run away to Chicago, hide out in movie theaters, and watch Gunga Din over and over. By high school, it’s clear that Ray is no student while Zock is destined for Harvard. Still, they grow up side-by-side, through adolescence, double-dating, and first love. But during a summer visit home, a tragic accident leaves Ray racked with guilt. Alone once again, Ray discovers that in the depths of despair, resilience and hope are waiting to be found.

The Problem of God: Yesterday and Today,"In an urbane and persuasive tract for our time, the distinguished Catholic theologian combines a comprehensive metaphysics with a sensitivity to contemporary existentialist thought. Father Murray traces the “problem of God” from its origins in the Old Testament, through its development in the Christian Fathers and the definitive statement by Aquinas, to its denial by modern materialism. Students and nonspecialist intellectuals may both benefit by the book, which illuminates the problem of development of doctrine that is now, even more than in the days of Newman, a fundamental issue between Roman Catholic and Protestant, theologians and nonspecialst intellectuals alike will find the subject of vital interest. As a challenge to the ecumenical dialogue, the question is raised whether, in the course of its development through different phases, the problem of God has come back to its original position. Father Murray is Ordinary professor of theology at Woodstock College, Woodstock, Maryland. St. Thomas More Lectures, 1. ""A gem of a book—lucid, illuminating, brilliantly written.

Lonigan,"Collected here in one volume is James T. Farrell's renowned trilogy of the youth, early manhood, and death of Studs Lonigan: Young Lonigan, The Young Manhood of Studs Lonigan, and Judgment Day. In this relentlessly naturalistic portrait, Studs starts out his life full of vigor and ambition, qualities that are crushed by the Chicago youth's limited social and economic environment. Studs's swaggering and vicious comrades, his narrow family, and his educational and religious background lead him to a life of futile dissipation. Ann Douglas provides an illuminating introductory essay to Farrell's masterpiece, one of the greatest novels of American literature.

Death of a Nation: American Culture and the End of Exceptionalism (Critical American Studies),"In the 1940s, American thought experienced a cataclysmic paradigm shift. Before then, national ideology was shaped by American exceptionalism and bourgeois nationalism: elites saw themselves as the children of a homogeneous nation standing outside the history and culture of the Old World. This view repressed the cultures of those who did not fit the elite vision: people of color, Catholics, Jews, and immigrants. David W. Noble, a preeminent figure in American studies, inherited this ideology. However, like many who entered the field in the 1940s, he rejected the ideals of his intellectual predecessors and sought a new, multicultural, post-national scholarship. Throughout his career, Noble has examined this rupture in American intellectual life. In Death of a Nation, he presents the culmination of decades of thought in a sweeping treatise on the shaping of contemporary American studies and an eloquent summation of his distinguished career. Exploring the roots of American exceptionalism, Noble demonstrates that it was a doomed ideology. Capitalists who believed in a bounded nationalism also depended on a boundless, international marketplace. This contradiction was inherently unstable, and the belief in a unified national landscape exploded in World War II. The rupture provided an opening for alternative narratives as class, ethnicity, race, and region were reclaimed as part of the nation's history. Noble traces the effects of this shift among scholars and artists, and shows how even today they struggle to imagine an alternative postnational narrative and seek the meaning of local and national cultures in an increasingly transnational world. While Noble illustrates the challenges thatthe paradigm shift created, he also suggests solutions that will help scholars avoid romanticized and reductive approaches toward the study of American culture in the future.",['David W.

Fugu Plan: The Untold Story of the Japanese and the Jews During World War Two,"If someone who is rich and powerful comes to you for a favor, you don't persecute him -- you help him. Having such a person indebted to you is a great insurance policy. There was one nation that did treat the Jews as if they were powerful and rich. The Japanese never had much exposure to Jews, and knew very little about them. In 1919 Japan fought alongside the anti-Semitic White Russians against the Communists. At that time the White Russians introduced the Japanese to the book, ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion"". The Japanese studied the book and, according to all accounts, naively believed its propaganda. Their reaction was immediate and forceful -- they formulated a plan to encourage Jewish settlement and investment into Manchuria. People with such wealth and power as the Jews possess, the Japanese determined, are exactly the type of people with whom we want to do business! The Japanese called their plan for Jewish settlement ""The Fugu Plan"". The fugu is a highly poisonous blowfish. After the toxin-containing organs are painstakingly removed, it is used as a food in Japan, and is considered an exquisite delicacy. If it is not prepared carefully, however, its poison can kill a person. The Japanese saw the Jews as a nation with highly valuable potential, but, as with the fugu, in order to take advantage of that potential, they had to be extremely careful. Otherwise, the Japanese thought, the plan would backfire and the Jews would annihilate Japan with their awesome power. The Japanese were allies of the Nazis, yet they allowed thousands of European refugees -- including the entire Mirrer Yeshivah -- to enter Shanghai and Kobe during World War II. They welcomed these Jews into their country, not because they bore any great love for the Jews, but because they believed that Jews had access to enormous resources and amazingly influential power, which could greatly benefit Japan. If anti-Semites truly believe that Jews rule the world, why don't they all relate to Jews like the Japanese did? The fact that Jews are generally treated as outcasts proves that people do not really believe that Jews are anywhere near as wealthy or powerful as they claim. It proves that anti-Semites do not take their own propaganda seriously.","['Marvin Tokayer', 'Mary Swartz']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5dCY1mp2R2gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=5dCY1mp2R2gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fugu+Plan:+The+Untold+Story+of+the+Japanese+and+the+Jews+During+World+War+Two&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Gefen Publishing House Ltd,2004,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5dCY1mp2R2gC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/968_Fugu_Plan__The_Untold_Story_of_the_Japanese_and_the_Jews_During_World_War_Two.jpg,History,1

And he gives a harrowing account of how the Allies did their utmost to turn the American Expeditionary Force into cannon fodder on the Western Front.Thoroughly researched and dramatically told, The Illusion of Victory offers compelling testimony to the power of a president's visionary ideals-as well as a starkly cautionary tale about the dangers of applying them in a war-maddened world.",['Thomas Fleming'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CYqPswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=CYqPswEACAAJ&dq=The+Illusion+of+Victory:+America+in+World+War+I&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Basic Books,2004-05-26,http://books.google.com/books?id=CYqPswEACAAJ&dq=The+Illusion+of+Victory:+America+in+World+War+I&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],,book_covers/810_The_Illusion_of_Victory__America_in_World_War_I.jpg,History,1

END OF ANTIQUITY,"Plague was a key factor in the waning of Antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Eight centuries before the Black Death, a pandemic of plague engulfed the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and eventually extended as far east as Persia and as far north as the British Isles. Its persisted sporadically from 541 to 750, the same period that witnessed the distinctive shaping of the Byzantine Empire, a new prominence of the Roman papacy and of monasticism, the beginnings of Islam and the meteoric expansion of the Arabic Empire, the ascent of the Carolingian dynasty in Frankish Gaul and, not coincidentally, the beginnings of a positive work ethic in the Latin West. In this volume, the first on the subject, twelve scholars from a variety of disciplines-history, archaeology, epidemiology, and molecular biology- have produced a comprehensive account of the pandemic's origins, spread, and mortality, as well as its economic, social, political, and religious effects. The historians examine written sources in a range of languages, including Arabic, Syriac, Greek, Latin, and Old Irish. Archaeologists analyze burial pits, abandoned villages, and aborted building projects. The epidemiologists use the written sources to track the disease's means and speed of transmission, the mix of vulnerability and resistance it encountered, and the patterns of reappearence over time. Finally, molecular biologists, newcomers to this kind of investigation, have become pioneers of paleopathology, seeking ways to identity pathogens in human remains from the remote past.",['Lester K.

Exploring Kenotic Christology: The Self-Emptying of God,"This collection of essays, by a team of Christian philosophers, theologians, and biblical scholars, explores the viability of a kenotic account of the incarnation. Such an account is inspired by Paul's lyrical claims in Philippians 2:6-11 that Christ Jesus, though God in nature, 'emptied himself' or 'made himself nothing' by becoming human. The biblical support for such a view can be found throughout the four gospels and the book of Hebrews, as well as in other places. A kenotic account takes seriously the possibility that Christ, in becoming incarnate, temporarily divested himself of such properties as omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence. Several of the contributors argue that this view is fully orthodox, and that it has great strengths in giving us a picture of a God who is willing to become completely vulnerable for the sake of human beings, and one that is completely consistent with the very human portrait of Jesus in the New Testament. The proponents of kenotic Christology argue that the philosophical accounts of God's nature that have led to rejection of this theory ought themselves to be subjected to criticism in light of the biblical data. Some essays test the theory by raising critical questions and arguing that traditional accounts of the incarnation can achieve the goals of kenotic theories as well as kenotic theories can. The book also explores the implications of a kenotic view of the incarnation for philosophical theology in general and the doctrine of the Trinity in particular, and it concludes with essays that examine the validity of the ideal of kenosis for women, and a challenge to traditional Christology to take a kenotic theory seriously.
